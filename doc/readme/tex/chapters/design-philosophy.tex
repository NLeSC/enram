\chapter{Organization of the software}
\label{ch:design-philosophy}


\section{Original problem}

Software has been developed by Adriaan Dokter and Martin de Graaf during previous projects. Adriaan's software is written in the C programming language, whereas most of Martin's work is in IDL. The two components work together to read radar signals from ODIM-HDF5 formatted files containing radar sensor data, most importantly reflectivities and radial velocities. The software can use these data to visualize the intensity of bird migration around a radar station, either as PPI's\footnote{\burl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_Position_Indicator}} or as altitude profiles. The software further includes algorithms to calculate cluttermaps for a given radar station.

Currently, data from the following stations are included:\\
