    that is equally distant from two given reference points.  RES
27 Aug 2007
  CW_MCLED: Added new keyword, MSG_ID=msg_id, to return the widget ID of
    the LED label.  If the label is blank for some states this area can be
    used to display other text while not needed by the LED.  RES
22 Aug 2007
  EVENT_LOG: Modified so a given event log file may have a full directory
    path, or not.  The full path will be returned for the getfile option
    and may then be sent to a later setfile to use a constant log file
    even when moving around to different directories.  RES
  ELL_TRACK_REDUCE_POINTS: Ne routine to reduce the number of points
    along a track.  Uses ELL_LL2TM to convert lon, lat of points
    to transverse mercator coordinates in meters, then uses
    PATH_REDUCE_POINTS to reduce the number of points.  Can return
    the index array to subset the track so other related arrays may also
    be subsetted.  RES
  ELL_LL2TM: New routine to convert from geographic longitude and
    latitude to transverse mercator coordinates in meters.  Can give
    a central longitude and add false northing and easting to get UTM
    coordinates (by default uses the mean longitude of given points as
    the central longitude ,and does not add false northing and easting).  RES
  PATH_REDUCE_POINTS: New routine to reduce the number of points along
    a path given their x,y coordinates.  Drops points inside straight
    parts of the path based on a given max allowed deviation from the
    original path.  Can make a big difference when there are a lot of 
    points along a path.  RES
20 Aug 2007
  FINDCMD: Was reversing found commands to display in order executed,
    but dropped the reverse so now displays most recent commands first.  RES

    and reverse azi to and from midpoint.  RES
5 Aug 2007
  ELL_GEO_PTS: The N=n (Number of points) option fixed.  RES
  ELL_GEO_MID: Added new keyword AZIMUTH to return the azimuth from
    point 1 to point 2.  RES
  ELL_LATCON: Convert between 3 types of latitude:
    PlanetoGraphic, Parametric, and PlanetoCentric.  RES
31 Jul 2007
  XHELP: Added new keyword /BOTTOM to put all the buttons at the
    bottom of the widget, instead of the top.  RES
30 Jul 2007
  CW_MCLED: Fixed to not change current window.  RES
27 Jul 2007
  CW_MCLED: Added DONE_LABEL=dlab.  When these LEDs are used to indicate
    processing status it is useful to have another off state with a label
    that is an after procesing label instead of the initial off state
    label.  This is an optional keyword.  RES
17 Jul 2007
  DT_TM_BRK: Fixed to work for all numeric dates that have no time as
    part of the date/time string.  A time string like 1945-09-22
   now defaults to 0 h.  RES
6 Jul 2007
  IMGCONTOUR: New routine to display a data array as an image with
    contours.  Uses current color table and quantizes it to the given
    number of levels.  May optionally shade the result which can show
    finer details.  Also does a matching color bar.  RES
5 Jul 2007
  NAXES: Forced a few more values double when computing first and
    last tick values.  RES
  PLOTWIN: Dropped old keyword CHARSIZE and added new keyword ERROR.
    Now returns an error if no plot has been done.  RES
29 Jun 2007
  TOPO2: New function to make a shading array for a given data array.
    Very similar to topo but with somewhat different scaling options.
    Returns an array in the range 0 to 1 as a shaded relief of the data.
    This array is useful for shading a color view of the data.  RES
14 Jun 2007
  PUTFILE: Made loop limit long int.  RES
12 Jun 2007
  MORE: Now allows up to 9 1-d arrays to be listed side by side.
    Do more,/help for more info.  RES
  ARG_PARSE: Added new keyword: /UNSORT to return keywords in original
    unsorted order.  May not be used with the /keymerge keyword.  RES
8 Jun 2007
  TARCLR: Minor internal change to how the 1 argument case is handled.
    Now if only first arg is defined the other args can still be given
    for the 1 arg case.  This makes it easier to write a wrapper to send
    input to tarclr.  RES
23 May 2007
  IGLOBE: Fixed a typo in the horizon flag.  RES
14 May 2007
  AARR: Now returns a null string (by default) on an error.  Can specify

8 May 2007
  IMG_DISP: Added new keyword /SCALE to bytescl 2-D non-palette images.  RES
  ZIPFARR__DEFINE: Object to handle an array of zipped files.  Items can be
    saved or retrieved from such an array by index.  Can save numeric
    scalars or arrays (but not text).  Intended for accessing large arrays
    by an index instead of trying to keep them all in memory.  RES
7 May 2007
  TYP2NUM: Now works for output of datatype(v,/descriptor) for scalar
    values.  So to save an item in a file can save its description from
    datatype(v,/descriptor) and use that to build a variable using
    typ2num to read back the actual item.
    Also revised scalar/array checking and it now should work for
    complex and dcomplex scalars and arrays.  RES
3 May 2007
  MAKECLR: New function to make an array of 24-bit colors.  Almost the
    same as color_array but has defaults.  RES
27 Apr 2007
  IMG_ICE: Now allows channels to be locked to together to scale.  A new
    button on the widget controls this and a new keyword, /LOCK, allows
    the initial state to be locked channels.  RES
24 Apr 2007
  LINE_FIT: Made sure needed values were defined if a line plot
    was requested.  RES
23 Apr 2007

5 Apr 2007
  WINWATCH: Made subarea outline default, use /nooutline to not
    outline the window(s).  RES
3 Apr 2007
  WINWATCH: Added new keyword ARRAY=arr.  If an array corresponding to the
    displayed image is given the statistics wil be listed for each
    subimage.  RES
21 Mar 2007
  RESCOM: Now may give an optional res file name to list (default is to
    list the currently opened file).  If a res file is given it is
    opened, listed, and closed.  RES
20 Mar 2007
  XVIEW: Added keyword cubic=-0.5 to magnify option.  RES
19 Mar 2007
  IMG_RESIZE: Added new keyword SMAG=smag to smooth a bit before resize.
    This makes text more readable but the image slightly less sharp.  RES
1 Mar 2007
  IMG_SUBAREA: New function to return a subarea of an image.  It is similar
    to img_subimg but that routine does not subareas outside the input 
    image.  The requested subarea may be completely or partially outside
    the input image.  The outside of the image may be specified with the
    keyword MISSING=m, 0 by default.  The returned result is always the
    requested size and the shape matches the input image.  The input image
    can be any numeric data type.  RES
  IMG_SHAPE: Added new keyword /QUIET.  RES
28 Feb 2007
  PLOT_POSBOX: New routine to plot the outline of a position box in the

22 Feb 2007
  WIN_REDIRECT: Checked if window is open before deleting.  RES
12 Feb 2007
  EXPLORE: Cursor box was broken.  Fixed by checking endian of system and
    swapping if needed.  RES
  WINWATCH: Added new keyword GET=out to return internal state values in a
    structure.  Also added new keyword SET=in to set internal state values
    from a structure.  This allows watch windows to easily be set up again,
    or the mag factors changed, or any internal values changed.  Also
    now checks that watch windows exist and recreates them if they do not.  RES
9 Feb 2007
  SCREENPNG: Added optional screen position args, px,py, that work like
    the pos or posx,posy args for the TV command.  These only work for the
    current window.  Else a new window is made.  Allows multiple images
    to be positioned inside a large window.  RES
  WINWATCH: Fixed to make sure window exists before deleting.  Also fixed a
    minor outline plot error.  Also now uses /samp with rebin.  RES
8 Feb 2007
  WINWATCH: Now allows multiple windows, can give arrays, defaults to all
    windows initialized, can save windows.  RES
  BOX2B: Fixed abort on first click error.  RES
6 Feb 2007
  RES_EXECUTE: Fixed to allow continued lines (end with $) in code blocks.
    Also added /debug which lists each command when executing.  
    Was dropping some comments, fixed.  RES
5 Feb 2007
  IMG_PLOT: Made sure background is 0 even if given.  RES
  IZOOM: Background color was not working for the /anitaliased option.
    Should now be fixed.  RES
24 Jan 2007
  WINWATCH: 
    New routine to display part of the current graphics window in another
    display window.  Very useful in looking at the details of part of an
    image as various commands are given.  Use a command like:
	tvscl,xyz & winwatch
    to see the result of xyz closeup.  RES
16 Jan 2007
  WIN_SIZE_SHAPE: Changed  MAXIMG keyword to default to the actual longest
    image side (was 900 pixesl).  RES
8 Jan 2007
  GENELLIPSE: Added the new keywords NUMBER=n, /NO_AXES.  RES
  ELLFITBIN: New routine to fit an ellipse to a binary image blob.  Was using
    ellfit but didn't like the fit so this routine was made using the
    method given on David Fanning's web page an attributed to
    Craig Markwardt.  This routine can be used directly in place of ellfit
    for a binary image and appears to do a better fit.  RES
4 Jan 2007
  SECSTR:    Made for loop index long.  RES
  YY2YYYY:   Made for loop index long.  RES
  DATE2YMD:  Made for loop index long.  RES

28 Dec 2006
  ELL_LOXODROME: Cleaned up a bit to get things all defined and returned
    correctly.  Need to split this routine into two like ell_rb2ll
    and ell_ll2rb.  Call them ell_lox_rb2ll, ell_lox_ll2rb, from2to.  RES
27 Dec 2006
  ELL_LOXODROME: Fixed a problem where the loxodrome might go the long
    way around the globe.  This was found and reported by Rick Chapman
    in Oct 2002.  RES
20 Dec 2006
  UNIQ_TAGVAL:  Now can return a lookup table for each original tag giving
    the index into the full array that was actually used (depends on
    which was used, /first or /last).  RES
19 Dec 2006
  UNIQ_TAGVAL: New procedure to drop repeated items from a tag, value
    pair of arrays.  The text array tag contains names of items and the
    array value contains the corresponding values (may be any data type).
    The tag array may have items repeated (value must be the same size).
    This routine drops repeated elements from both arrays.  The first or last
    values found for each tag may be specified as the one returned.  May
    also return the array of indices selected so the corresponding elements
    of any other associated arrays may also be extracted. 
    May call with just tag, tag2 if value array not needed.  RES
  AARR: Added /NO_UPDATE option to use with /ADD to not update the
    value when giving an exsiting key.  This allows the first value to
    be kept. RES
18 Dec 2006
  AARR:  Dropped /UPDATE, made /ADD do an update.  Cleaned up INDEX to
    always be the Key.  RES
15 Dec 2006
  AARR: Added new keywords /QUIET, /UPDATE, ERROR=err.  Also now defines
    array on /ADD if it was not defined.  Modified to not add the same key
    again.  RES
8 Dec 2006
  RESGET_ONE: New function to get one item from a res file.  RES
6 Dec 2006
  IMG_FITPRINT: Added a border of specified thickness and color around the
    edge of the reshaped image.  RES
  NUMNAME: Now the number of digits can be specified for each of the
    given numbers.  RES
5 Dec 2006
  TXTMERCON: New function to merge continued lines in a text array.
    Lines are continued if they have a line continuation character at
    their ends.  The default line continuation character is $ (like for IDL)
    but may be specified.  The returned text array will have continued
    lines merged together.  RES
  ARG_PARSE: Made several upgrades.  Repeated keywords are now handled
    better (before only first was used).  Now they are renamed to full
    name (if requested), and may be merged.  RES
  IGLOBE: Added new keyword NAME=name to allow a map projection to be given
    to over-ride the default orthographic projection.  Can find names from
    map_proj_info, proj_names=names.  RES
4 Dec 2006
  DATATYPE: Added new keyword NUMBYTES=nb to return the total number of
    bytes in the given variable.  RES
1 Dec 2006
  IGLOBE: Colors may now be 24-bit values (or [r,g,b] as before).  RES
9 Nov 2006
  DT_TM_TOJS: Added the new keyword FORMAT=fmt, same as for DT_TM_BRK.
    This can make it very easy to pick times out of a list of file
    names without picking apart the file names first.  RES
  DT_TM_BRK: Added new keywords FORMAT=fmt and DATE_FORMAT=dfmt to
    allow formats to be specified for dates like 06oct03_0108.
    See the help for details.  RES
7 Nov 2006
  ANG_DIFF: New function to give the difference between two angles in
    degrees.  Handles the discontinuety at 0/360.  So the difference from
    10 to 20 deg is 10 deg, the difference from 350 to 10 degrees is
    20 degrees (10 to 350 gives -20).  Useful for comparing two angles
    to see if they point in about the same direction.  RES
7 Nov 2006
  MAP_PUT_SCALE: Just made the /LIST keyword work as stated.  RES
6 Nov 2006
  IMG_MAP_IMAGE: Now handles 2-D image case.  RES
1 Nov 2006
  TXTGETKEY: Just a minor fix to the help text.  RES
24 Oct 2006
  ARG_PARSE: Corrected an error in processing keywords.  RES
23 Oct 2006
  CW_DSLIDER: Modified to allow the slider color to be changed.  The slider
    value is set using the widget_control routine:
	widget_control, wid, set_val=val
    where wid is the widget ID of the slider, and val is the new value to set.
    Normally val is a numeric value which sets the slider marker to that value
    on the slider.  The color may be changed by setting val to a string like
    'color=123456' where the number is a 24-bit color.  RES
20 Oct 2006
  ARG_PARSE: Added new keywords, NPARAMS=np and ERROR=err.  If NPARAMS
    is given it is the number of positional args wanted.  Anything other
    than that gives an error message and sets the error flag.  The structure
    is still returned as before.  RES
18 Oct 2006
  ARG_PARSE: New routine to parse an argument list.  Argument list is a
    single scalar text string with positional and/or keyword arguments
    delimited by commas.  Values are returned in a structure that gives
    the number of positions arguments (0 if none), the number of keyword
    arguments (0 if none), the keyword names and values (if any).
    Optional inputs may be used to allow keywords to be abbreviated but
    returned with full names.  Flags, like /all, are considered keywords
    with a value of 1.  All returned values are strings.  The keyword
    names and values are returned in name sorted order.  RES
  STRFIND: Added the new keywords IINDEX=iind and ICOUNT=icnt to return
    the inverse indices and count when /INVERSE is not used.  When /INVERSE
    is used these values come back through the INDEX=ind and COUNT=cnt
    keywords.  This makes /INVERSE obsolete but it is kept for backward
    compatibility.  Now strfind can be used to locate certain text array
    elements and easily drop them from the array using the inverse indices. RES
11 Oct 2006
  D2DM: New function to convert degrees to degrees and minutes.  RES
9 Oct 2006
  IMG_AA__DEFINE: Image antialiase object.  Added debug method.
    Also added /CLIP to multipoly method.  RES
  MAP_PUT_SCALE: Added new keywords: MAG=mag to modify map scale in
    info array (that is embedded in the image), and /LIST to list the
    values in the info array.  MAG is useful to create a map at a larger
    size and resize and then embedded corrected map scaling info.  This
    is useful for making antialiased maps with embedded scaling info.  RES
  MAP_EMBEDDED_INFO: Forced modified scale to a floating value.  RES
6 Oct 2006
  UTM2LATLON: New routine to convert from UTM coordinates to lat, lon.
    Works in WGS84 by default but may give the working ellipsoid.  RES
4 Oct 2006
  LONLAT2SHAPE: Added an optional attributes structure and fixed the
    displayed # of points.  RES
  MAP_EMBEDDED_INFO: New procedure to display and/or modify embedded
    scaling info generated by map_set2.  This info is used to automatically
    set up the map scaling when a map is loaded so points may be measured
    or plotted on the map.  This routine displays the exact values from this
    embedded info and also allows it to be modified and embedded in the
    current window.  This allows a magnified map image to be displayed and
    have its embedded scaling updated for the new size.  RES
27 Sep 2006
  TAG_TEST: Added new keyword MINLEN to deal with keywords that might be
    abbreviated in the structure (such as in _extra).  RES
  TAG_VALUE: Added new keyword MINLEN to deal with keywords that might be
    abbreviated in the structure (such as in _extra).  RES
  TAG_ADD: New routine to add or update a tag value in a structure.
    Can match abbreviated tags using the MINLEN.  WIll add the tag
    if not found in the structure, else it will be updated.  RES
  CHECK_SHAPEFILE: Listed a few more values for the file.  Needs
    a bit more work at some point.  RES
26 Sep 2006
  ELL_GEO_INT: New routine to find the intersection point of two
    geodesics (if there is one).  RES
  ELL_GEO_SIDE: New function that determines which side of a given geodesic
    a given point is on.  Useful in determining if one geodesic crosses
    another geodesic.  RES

    distances between points in a given array.  RES
  ELL_GEO_MID: New function to return the midpoint of a geodesic
    given the endpoints.  RES
  ELL_GEO_INTERP_PTS: New routine to interpolate points along a geodesic
    between adjacent points in the given arrays if they are farther
    than a specified distance apart.  Can use to fill in between points
    spaced too far apart.  RES
  GETFILE_TAGS: Made sure err defined.  RES
  TXTGETKEY: Modified to use typ[]instead of typ().  RES
25 Sep 2006
  IMG_AA__DEFINE: New object to do antialiased graphics on an image.
    Can load an existing image or set up a window.  Can do xy plots,
    curves (like oplot), polygons, and text.  Keeps a larger internal
    working image in memory.  RES
25 Sep 2006
  SCREENPNG: Added mag=mag to the set_scale call.  So images with
    embedded scaling are now scaled correctly when magnified.  RES
  SET_SCALE: Add MAG=mag to correctly apply embedded scaling for magnified
    images.  RES

  XGETVALS_DEMO: Improved version.  No screen flicker, can drag master
    area around and drag to resize.  RES
  IMG_FITPRINT: New procedure to add margin to an image to make it fit
    a specified print size.  None of the image is cropped, area is added
    if needed to fit the size given.  Useful for getting an image ready
    to make a poster size (or any other size) print on a photo web site.  RES
6 Sep 2006
  GETFILE_TAGS: Added new keyword TYPE=typ to convert structure items to a
    requested data type.  Also added /NOSORT to keep the same order as in the
    text file.  RES
  TXTGETKEY: Added new keyword TYPE=typ which, when used with the /STRUCTURE
    keyword, takes an array of data type codes (same as given by the size
    function) and converts the structure items to the requested data type.  RES
  TO_DATATYPE: New function to convert a given variable to a specified
    data type using the type codes given by the size function.  RES
  TXT_KEYSECTION: New procedure to extract a section of a text array
    between given keys.  This could be used to customize a control or
    defaults file for the operating system for example.  The file could
    have a section between the lines [windows_start] and [windows_end]
    and the lines between those keys either all kept or all dropped
    after being read into a text array (the key lines are not returned
    in either case).  RES
5 Sep 2006
  MAP_LATLNG_RECT: New to this library (moved from another library).
   Plot a rectangle in latitude and longitude on a map displayed in the
   current plot window.  RES
  MAPRECT: New to this library (moved from another library).
    Plot a rectangle of specified size at a specified center on a
    map displayed in the current plot window.  Size may be
    given with one of a number of known units.  RES
  MAPCIRC: New to this library (moved from another library).
    Plot a circle of specified radius at a specified center on a
    map displayed in the current plot window.  Radius may be
    given with one of a number of known units.  RES
  MAPCIRCI: New to this library (moved from another library).
    This routine displays a circle on a map in the current plot window.
    The circle may be moved around using the mouse.  A set of points
    may be given (lat, long, name) and their names will be listed
    if they are inside the circle when the mouse is left clicked.  The
    points should be plotted on the map before calling this routine.
    The radius of the circle may be changed and entered in one of
    several known units.  RES
5 Sep 2006
  XGETVALS_DEMO: New routine that does a demonstration call to xgetvals.  RES
  XGETVALS: Added INIT_PRO=ipro to specify an initializtion procedure.
    Must take the same arguments as an action procedure (can use an action
    procedure).  RES
1 Sep 2006
  XGETVALS: Modified to allow returned values in a structure in addition
    to a text array.  May give the tag names for the structure.  This makes
    using the values easier since they may be referenced by name.
    Also added Action Buttons.  These can call a user procedure that takes
    the values structure and a list of text entry areas widget IDs as
    arguments.  This can allow an action button to do an action based on
    the values in the input areas, or update values anywhere in the panel
    and not just in a single row like the row buttons.  RES
29 Aug 2006
  LLSIGNED: Corrected help to work.  Also now allows D M S form, with'
    N, E, W, S allowed anywhere in string if there at all.  RES
20 Aug 2006
  SMOOTH2: Added keyword /FILL_ENDS.  This will copy the first or last
    value actually smoothed to fill in the ends of the resulting array.
    Useful to avoid ragged edges that may drive autoscaling.  RES
15 Aug 2006
  SATLATLNG2ALTAZI: Routine to find a satellite's altitude and azimuth
    as viewed from a given earth location.  Moved from the IDL library
    IDLNOAA.  Added comments.  RES

    where specially constructed tag values are first processed, others
    are just copied as is.  The specially constructed values are strings
    with three parts: a prefix word, a function name, the rest of the
    string to be used as the argument to the function.  The prefix is by
    default the word apply.  This function when used with getfile_tags
    can be used to process a control file.  For example, environmental
    variables could be set using an entry like 'apply setenv test=123'.
    Or a list could be converted to an actual array with something like
    'apply list2arr [2,3,5,7,11,13]' where list2array would know how to
    convert the string [2,3,5,7,11,13] to a numeric array.  RES
7 Jul 2006
  GETFILE_TAGS: Now drops all comments.  Was finding an = in the
    comments.  RES
6 Jul 2006
  AARR: New function that simulates an associative array.  Often this can
    be done in IDL using a structure where the tags are the keys.  But this
    does not always work.  Hash tables are useful for large jobs but
    may be overkill for small tasks.  This routine fills that place.
    This function allows array entries to be accessed, added or dropped.  RES
29 Jun 2006
  XYPRO_RADON: A new routine to be called from crossi as an xypro routine.
    Used to see which points in a radon transform correspond to which lines
    in the original image.  See built-in help for details.  RES
  IMG_RADON: New routine to compute the radon transform of a given image.
    Works for color or black and white images.  The result for a color
    image is a color radon transform which may be displayed as a color
    image after scaling.  See also xypro_radon.pro.
28 Jun 2006
  IZOOM: Added new keyword /NOSCALE.  By default now embedded scaling is
    added to the window when izoom is called.  This keyword supresses that. RES
26 Jun 2006
  RTICS: Added new keywords: color=c, linestyle=s, thickness=t, 
    /device, /data, /norm (more like arcs.pro).  RES
19 Jun 2006
  PUTFILE_TAGS: Just added a note in the help text pointing to
     getfile_tags.  RES
  GETFILE_TAGS: Just added a note in the help text pointing to
     putfile_tags.  RES
8 Jun 2006
  TXTDB_RD: Made all loop limits long ints.  RES
7 Jun 2006
  DATE2YMD: Now allows numeric dates like 051506 to be used with the
    numeric date keywords (like /MDY with /YYYY).  RES
5 Jun 2006
  TPRINT: Fixed BUFFER=buf for ADD and OUT.  RES
  IMGPOLREC: Added custom mask values.  RES
  IMG_8TO24: New routine to convert an 8-bit image to 24-bit using a color
    lookup table.  RES
  ABS_PATH: Fixed to work for non-relative paths.  RES
5 May 2006
  FAST_MAP: Fixed toggle USA on/off.  Was still plotting USA in
    coast colors.  Also fixed startup color problem.  RES
3 May 2006
  WAV_PLAY: Now allows multiple wave files.  RES
  TEXT_BLOCK: Allowed longer lines (was only 99 characters).  RES
27 Apr 2006
  EVENT_LOG: Added new keyword: GETFILE=file to return the event log
    file name.  RES
26 Apr 2006
  TPRINT: Now allows a working buffer to be specified instead of the
    default internal buffer.  This was needed when several routines
    were trying to use tprint and they interfered with each other.
    This allows any number of tprint sessions to be used at the same time. RES
  WAV_PLAY: New routine to play a wave file.  RES
25 Apr 2006
  ABS_PATH: New function to convert a relative path to an absolute path.
    Can give a base directory, def=current.  So
    abs_path('../../xx.dat',base='/aaa/bbb/ccc/ddd')
    gives /aaa/bbb/xx.dat.  RES
20 Apr 2006
  XGETVALS: Fixed a minor bug that didn't allow slashes in row headings.  RES
19 Apr 2006
  HORIZON_DIST: New function to compute distance to the horizon for a
    given observer height.  By default the distance corrected for 
    atmospheric refraction is returned.  Refraction can vary a lot
    so this distance is only a rough guide.  RES
18 Apr 2006
  GETFILE_TAGS: Modified to return all tags with null string values
    if the file does not exist.  Useful when initializing values.  RES
17 Apr 2006
  PUTFILE_TAGS: Modified to create a file if it does not exist.  Make
    sure to use the /ADD keyword in this case or the file will be
    blank.  The file may be edited after creating to have a better
    format (but that is not necessary for use).  RES
  COLOR_CODE: New function to make an array of colors to be used in a call to
    the IDL routine PLOTS.  This function takes an array of values, one for
    each point to plot, and maps the values into colors.  Currently the
    values map into hues, sat and val are set to 1.  This function can be
    called right in the plots statement so it is easy to color code various
    values.  For example, when plotting a GPS track it is easy to color
    code the point index (which indicates which way the track was traveled),
    or sensor speed, or altitude or # satellites, or hdop, ...  RES
14 Apr 2006
  PUTFILE_TAGS: New procedure to update selected tags in a control/defaults
    file.  Give file name (or string array with text as if read from the file)
    and a structure with the values to be updated in the file (or string
    array).  May give new tags not in the file but must use the /ADD
    keyword to add them (at end of file).  A useful item to add is a tag
    named something like UPDATED with the current time.  That will be
    added the first time and updated after.  This routine along with
    getfile_tags are useful in keeping track of a state of some software
    system between IDL sessions.  Using simple text files makes it
    human readable and allows easy editing of the file.  RES
  GETFILE_TAGS: New function to get all or selected tags from a control or
    defaults file.  The file is assumed to have tag=value lines
    (may also have other lines).  A list of tag names is given (may be
    a list in a string or a string array) and the matching values are
    returned in a structure with the tag names being the structure tags.  RES
13 Apr 2006
  XGETVALS: Now button procedures take only a single argument, an array of
    widget IDs for all the text areas on the row.  Any other items needed
    by the button routine should be passed in before calling from xgetvals.
    An easy way to do that is to use keywords and test if each one is
    defined, if so save a copy in common.  If the widget ID array was not
    passed in just return.  RES
11 Apr 2006
  LINI: Fixed the problem of 0 distance in /MAP mode.  RES
10 Apr 2006
  COLOR_ARRAY: New routine to return an array of colors when given
    how many and the ranges for hue, sat, and val.  Useful with plots
    to color code a curve.  RES
  LINI: Added /MAP mode to work with map data.  This displays azimuth
    and distance between the line endpoints in several units.  RES
  BOX2B: Just added some help text stating how to get a new box.  If
    x1,x2,y1,y2 are all set to -1 it will be the same as the first
    time box2b is called, no existing box will appear, just drag open
    a new box.   This is useful when zooming for example, the old box
    may be out of the new area.  RES
30 Mar 2006
  XVIEW: Made directory listing operating system dependent.  RES
  PATH: Added note to help text to double any backslashes used in the
    FRONT keyword when using in Windows IDL.  This is needed because the
    backslash is an escape character in stregex, so to avoid its special
    meaning it must be escaped using a backslash.  RES
  M_GET: Fixed to deal with unknown area name.  RES
  DATUM_SA1956_TO_WGS84: An example datum shift routine.  RES
  IMGRECPOL: Minor addition of a few trailing quotes.  RES
  RTURTLE__DEFINE: Minor upgrades for plotting the turtle.  RES
  STATION_MODEL: Just updated a comment.
27 Mar 2006
  TXTDB_RD: Added two new keywords: DROP=drop, and /NODROP.  Now by default
    any lines with ; or * in first column will be considered comment lines
    and be dropped before any processing.  The comment characters may be set
    using DROP=drop, like DROP='#' or DROP='!*'.  To avoid dropping default
    comment lines use /NODROP.  This all allows lines to be commented out
    without deleting them.  RES
21 Mar 2006
  TXTDB_RD: Now handles DMS format values (see below).  RES
  TYP2NUM: Added a new special case data type DMS to represent values in
    'degrees minutes seconds' format, like '330 30 12.3456'.  typ2num
    considers this data type to be a string, but the user's code can
    deal with it as a special case: if typ eq 'DMS' then out=dms2d(in).
    Also added FTYPE=ftyp to return the upper case full type name for
    use in the user's code.  RES
  D2DMS: Moved the " symbol to after the fraction of seconds instead
    of before (as used in some places).  This allows the result to
    work with dms2d correctly.  RES
19 Mar 2006
  ELL_RB2LL: Added method reference to comments.  RES
  ELL_LL2RB: Added method reference to comments.  RES
16 Mar 2006
  IMG_DISP: Tried to set window title but can't for none scrolling
    windows.  Fixed.  RES
15 Mar 2006
  ELL_CYL_EQ_AREA: Added /SIGNED to return signed area.  RES
  POLYSTAT: Added /SIGNED to return signed area (no abs(area)).  RES
  DATUM_NAD27_TO_WGS84:  Was named incorrectly and the help text had the
    same naming error.  Fixed.  RES
14 Mar 2006
  SCREENPNG: Added new keyword /NOSWIN to avoid using a scrolling
    window if the image will fit on the screen.  RES
  FAST_MAP: Added countries.  RES
  XGETVALS: Added optional buttons to fill in row values.  Also
    row headings.  Added optional drop_down lists.  RES
  XTXTIN: Fixed problem when calling from a widget.  A typo prevented
    the group leader keyword from being handled correctly.  RES
  WDRAW_BUTTONS: Changed background brightness for Windows.  RES
  CW_MCLED: Changed background brightness for Windows.  RES
  WINLIST: Fixed to work for Windows.  The format of the output from
    the HELP command was a bit different and needed to be considered.  RES
8 Mar 2006
  VUMOV: Had added dialog_pickfile for input file a bit ago but never
    moved it to the main library.  RES
  RESCLOSE: Fixed a problem that came up when resfiles were closed outside
    of resclose, like with close,/all.  resclose would blow up in that case
    but now checks if that is the case and cleans up.  RES
7 Mar 2006
  EQV3: Ignored leading spaces in equation file.  RES
  GETWRD: Added new keywords: /KEEP_LEADING_DEL and /KEEP_TRAILING_DEL.
    These will return leading or trailing delimiters with the returned
    result if they were there to start.  They are always there for
    words between the first and last.  Also cleaned up the code a bit.  RES
21 Feb 2006
  RNGBOX: New routine to return new xrange and yrange arrays using an
    interactive box.  Useful to zoom into a plot.  RES
20 Feb 2006
  WDRAW_BUTTONS: Added multiline labels and colored buttons.  RES
19 Feb 2006
  C2HSV: Fixed a minor typo.  RES
  WDRAW_BUTTONS: New routine to make images to use as buttons in
    draw widgets.  Can have an up image and a down image.  Can add
    labels and optional make labels that glow when on.  RES
19 Feb 2006
  CW_MCLED: The help text was missing a return statement.  Fixed.  Also
    dealt with operating system depend values, such as the background level
    that matches the widget color.  Adjusted dark halo to be a bit darker
    to highlight on state a bit more.  RES
13 Feb 2006
  ELL_CYL_EQ_AREA: Added two new keywords:
    NAME=name Name of area, and /POLYGON.  These give a more convenient listing
    for named areas.  Also added OUT=txt to return the message instead of
    printing it.  RES
7 Feb 2006
  ELL_LL2RB: Added to help text to avoid 0 distance.  Didn't see an
    easy way to catch that case yet.  RES
31 Jan 2006
  LEG: Added new keyword BOLD=bold to apply to labels and the title.  RES
25 Jan 2006
  IMG_DISP: Added /quiet to swindow call.  Also now allows MAG or SMAG
    to be 2-d to get x and y mag factors.  SMAG only smooths if
    the mag factor is < 1 (min of x and y mag).  RES
24 Jan 2006
  VUMOV: Upgraded error handling in the call user routine error handler.
    Now gives a useful error message.  RES
23 Jan 2006
  GET_ELLIPSOID: Added unit sphere and 1000 km sphere.  RES
17 Jan 2006
  IMG_DISP: Added new keyword /pixmap.  RES
10 Jan 2006
  ELL_LL2RB: Fixed a minor error in the calculation pointed out by
    Robert Jensen.  It made a difference of about 10 cm over 1 deg of
    latitude.  Inverse using the new results appeared to work to
    13 dec. places.  RES
21 Nov 2005
  IMGPOLREC: Added new keyword /LAST to use last computed indices.
    This is much faster than recomputing them each time.  RES
  BASECON: Now supports negative integers (16 and 32 bit only).
    Also allows spaces in input string.  This is useful for binary
    values.  RES
15 Nov 2005
  RESCOM: Now blanks out the <Press RETURN to continue> message when
    continuing for unix systems.  RES
10 Nov 2005
  RES_TAGLIST: Made the default value of PIX be 8  instead of 7.
    Also add new keywords: NCOLS=nx, NROWS=ny to control the max
    rows and columns in the table if /LIST is given.  RES
4 Nov 2005
  GRID: Added new keyword THICK=thk to set the grid line thickness.
    This can be useful when making antialiased figures.  Also
     made sure data coordinates have been setup, returns if not.  RES
2 Nov 2005
  NPOW: Routine to plot a diagram representing a number to a power.
    Demonstrates the turtle graphics object.  RES
26 Oct 2005
  NEWSWEB: Nows allows an optional file in the newsletter directory
    (monthly directory) that contains HTML code for the separator between
    articles.  The default is <p><hr><p>.  This options allows better
    control, for example, an image might be used as an article
    separator: <br><img src="sep.png"><p>
    The image used should be in the same directory (the newsletter
    directory).  RES
21 Oct 2005
  NEWSWEB: Added help to the front of this routine.  RES
13 Oct 2005
  HOR: Made loop indices long.  RES
  VER: Made loop indices long.  RES
  BOX2B: Just added the word "device" to the help text to make it more
    clear that the routine works in device coordinates only.  RES
5 Oct 2005
  C2HSV: Added note to point to rgb2c as inverse.  RES
  C2RGB: Added note to point to rgb2c as inverse.  RES
  RGB2C: New routine to convert from RGB (or HSV) to 24-bit color.
    Can handle mixed array and scalar inputs.  Inverse of c2rgb and c2hsv.  RES
23 Sep 2005
  SET_SCALE: Added new keyword: OUT=out.  Returns embedded scaling info
    in a structure.  RES
19 Sep 2005
  COMPLOT: Just added a color keyword to be a bit more standard.  RES
13 Sep 2005
  XOPTION: Added new keyword SENSITIVE=sens to allow an array of flags to
    be given to control the sensitivity of the menu buttons.  This allows
    buttons to be grayed out, useful to indicate a state of the program.
    Currently no check is made for all the buttons grayed out.  RES
9 Sep 2005
  DIGITIZE: Major upgrade in the interface.  RES
8 Sep 2005
  XCURVE: Was not erasing last rubber band line on exit.  Fixed.  RES
7 Sep 2005
  TXTGETKEY: Just added a comment that IDL reserved words may not be used
    as keywords when returning as a structure since they are not allowed
    as structure tag names.  RES
  STRDELARR: New routine to convert a byte array with strings delimited
    by 0 or some other ascii character to a string array.  Will stop
    processing the byte array if the string END is found.  Useful for
    reading an ascii header embedded in a binary file where the header
    has 0 (or sometimes LF (=ascii 10)) delimited entries.  RES
  XCURVE: Added a wait after deleting a point.  RES
  DIGITIZE: Changed /AUTOCENTER to /NOAUTOCENTER so autocentering is
    default.  RES
6 Sep 2005
  DIGITIZE: Now uses 5 calibration points.  The coordinates where the axes
    cross may not be known so now it is computed using the 5 points.
    Also now prompts to position a scrolling window if needed and
    can follow along when tracing the curve if the keyword /AUTOCENTER
    is used.  RES
  XCURVE: Added new keyword /AUTOCENTER to try to automatically center
    the latest point.  Useful when tracing a curve in a scrolling window
    but not when tracing while keeping the left mouse button pressed.  RES
  SWINCENTER: New routine to center a given point in a scrolling window.
    Ignored for normal windows.  If point is too close edge it will not
    be centered but should be visible.  RES
  SWSHAKE: Just added more comments so the techniques can be used
    elsewhere.  RES
1 Sep 2005
  DIGITIZE: New routine to trace the points on a curve in a plot in an
    image.  RES
26 Aug 2005
  EVENT_LOG: Now allows multiline text entries.  RES
19 Aug 2005
  VER: Added new keyword YRANGE=yran.  Allows a partial line to be drawn.  RES
  HOR: Added new keyword XRANGE=xran.  Allows a partial line to be drawn.  RES
9 Aug 2005
  MORE: Allowed more digits when displaying index number. RES
2 Aug 2005
  DATA_SEGMENT: New routine to return locations of segments of data in
    an array.  Segments are of specified length, returns the starting
    indices of each segment aand start and length of any left over
    segment.  Useful for processing arrays in large chunks.  RES
  MAPGCI: Attempted to do a better job on picking a step size along
    the initial great circle.  RES
  XHELP: Fixed a minor problem with an undefined variable.  RES
22 Jul 2005
  ELL_RB2LL_TXT: New routine to convert a text file with ranges and
    bearings to latitudes and longitudes.  See ell_rb2ll_txt,/help for
    details.  RES
20 Jul 2005
  IMG_ILLUMINATE: Added the temporary function to reduce memory needs.  RES
19 Jul 2005
  RESGET_SLICE: New routine to read 2-D arrays (slices) and return them
    stacked into a 3-D array.  Slices are ordinary res file items but
    have a sequence number in their name.  For example, if stk_000, stk_001,
    stk_002, stk_003 are 2-D arrays they may be read into a 3-D array
    be resget_slice, 'stk',stk.  All res file entries of the form
    stk* will be considered as slices.  In the example 'stk_' could be
    used if needed to avoid problems with stk1, stk2, ...
    This routine checks to make sure the data type and dimensions of
    all the slices match but does not check the sequence numbers in any
    way (so stk_cat, stk_dog, stk_bird, ... would work if their type and
    dimensions matched).  Also may give index ranges for each dimension:
    XRAN=xr, YRAN=yr, ZRAN=zr, def=full range.
    This way to access data in a res file is very useful for large 3-d
    arrays, they need not be stored in memory, they can be written to the
    res file slice by slice and later read in as a 3-D array.  RES
11 Jul 2005
  VARY: Added /uniq to the taggedwords call to find the slider parameters.
    For multiple references to a parameter the program was requesting
    multiple range values.  Also added a bit more help text.  RES
29 Jun 2005
  MOVBOX: Added new keyword ECHO=win2 to echo box in a second window.  RES
  BOX_SIZE: Added new keyword ECHO=win2 to echo box in a second window.
    This routine is called by movbox.pro.  RES
28 Jun 2005
  RBAR: Fixed to avoid clobbering existing map scaling.  RES
27 Jun 2005
  RBAR: New routine to plot a color that has colors indicating ranges
    of values (not a smooth color bar).  Uses plot keywords to control
    bar position and other properties.  RES
  BOX1: Added new keyword, ECHO=win2, to echo the same box in a
    second window.  RES
  TVBOX: Added new keyword, ECHO=win2, to echo the same box in a
    second window.  RES
21 Jun 2005
  XLINER: Now can display full source code.  RES
  XHELP: Added a new button to display a second set of text.  
    It will toggle between the original and new text.  Can also
    set the button label.  If a save text button exists it will save
    whichever text is displayed.
15 Jun 2005
  MAP_SET2: Now included pixels/cm for both x and y in the embedded map
    scaling.  This is used by map_set_scale to adjust the embedded value
    for scale for different screen sizes.  May not work if x and y scales
    differ (only use y pix/cm for now).  RES
  MAP_SET_SCALE: Use new pixels/cm that has been added to the embedded map
    scaling to adjust for different screen sizes.  Should be very close
    but can use the scale_factor keyword to do any needed fine tuning.  RES
20 May 2005
  TAGS_COMP: New routine to list the values of a tag in two structures.
    Can give a list of tags to list or list all tags that are in both
    structures.   Will flag which pairs are unequal (or equal). RES
16 May 2005
  HLP: Just added OUT=txt and /QUIET keywords to be passed on into
    hlp2.  Only works for IDL 6.1 or later.  RES
13 May 2005
  VARY: New routine to execute IDL code with parameters that can be varied
    using slider bars.  See vary,/help for details.  RES
  EQV3: Better handling of YSCROLL, on Linux for now.  May differ on
    Windows.  May also depend on font size.  RES
  TAGGEDWORDS: New routine to find words in a given text string that are
    tagged with a specified character.  Such tags would normally be
    special symbols such as #,$,@, and so on, but may be any character.
    A text string may have several sets of tagged words, each set using
    a different tag and obtained using multiple calls to taggedword.
    The /REMOVE keyword is useful to clear out the tag characters
    after using them to locate words.  RES
6 May 2005
  RES_TO_STRUCT: Added new keyword INCLUDE=include to allow a list
    of items to be give that will be included when otherwise they would
    have been excluded.  Useful with the keywords /NOARRAYS to include
    a few arrays, or with /ARRAYS_ONLY to include a few non-arrays.  RES
2 May 2005
  XCURSOR: New keyword ECHO=win to echo the cursor in a specified window.
    The window should be the same size as the active window.  RES
  HLP1: Fixed to work for objects, structures, pointers.  RES
29 Apr 2005
  HLP: Added /STRUCTURE keyword.  RES
  HLP2: Upgraded to deal with expanded structures.  RES
  HLP1: Works for old IDL (pre IDL 6.1).  RES
  HLPST: New routine to list expanded structures.  RES
28 Apr 2005
  DATATYPE: Was not giving datatype for a scalar when /descriptor was
    used.  Now fixed.  RES
27 Apr 2005
  HLP2: Updated version of hlp that gives variable names.  Only
    works for IDL6.1 or later.  RES
  DATATYPE: Fixed to work for scalar pointer with /descriptor.  RES
20 Apr 2005
  MULTIBAND: Added new keyword /REVERSE to reverse the hues (given
    or default).  RES
19 Apr 2005
  LASTINDEX: From the name of this routine it would be expected that it
    would return the last index value for each dimension.  Corrected
    to do that now but the keyword /SIZE was added to allow fairly
    easy backward compatability.  RES
  TVBOX: Was blowing up on first call if /noerase not used.  Fixed.  RES
18 Apr 2005
  JSPLOT: Now allows date/time strings to be used in time range
    (TRANGE) keyword.  RES
12 Apr 2005
  GCEIL: Generalized ceil function.  Can specifiy an interval
    other than 1.  RES
  GFLOOR: Generalized floor function.  Can specifiy an interval
    other than 1.  RES
  NEAREST: Upgraded to work for bigger numbers.  RES
8 Apr 2005
  ROUNDN:  Added /L64 switch to the internal call to the IDL round
    function to allow much bigger arguments.  RES
4 Apr 2005
  EQV3: Added x and y scroll keywords for the parameter slider area.
    This allows lots of parameters to be used without the widget
    growing too big.  RES
30 Mar 2005
  COLOR_PICK: Fixed problem where wheel marker sometimes did not erase
    completely when moved under Windows IDL.  The plotted marker
    position was in double precision but the saved position to erase
    was only single precision.  Made plotted coordinates single.  RES
23 Mar 2005
  AUTOCOLOR: New routine to print text on an image using colors from the
    image.  This simple version may pick an uncommon color at times.
    Should try to pick common colors.  RES
3 Mar 2005
  RESCOM: Added new keyword /ARRAYS to list arrays and their sizes in
    a res file.  Includes the front end and header to total to the
    exact file size.  RES
  TYP2NUM: Added new keyword /BYTES which will return the total number
    of bytes in the item describes without actually creating it.  Useful
    for adding up sizes of arrays.  Also now allows arr in the item
    description, like bytarr(3,4) (case ignored).  Also added CHR as
    a data type (1 byte). RES
22 Feb 2005
  MAKENXYZ: New routine to create 3-D x, y, and Z arrays.  Like
    makenxy but for 3 dimensions.  Useful for creating 3-D functions.
    Example:

	slicer3,ptr_new((r lt .85)*(2+cos(20*r)/(2+r)))    RES
  WINLIST: Modified listing format to be same as IDL code to make the
    window.  Then the window command can be swept up and pasted into
    a notes file.  RES
21 Feb 2005
  PLOTSHAPE: Added new keywords: DX=dx, DY=dy.  Allows overlays to be
    shifted.  RES
  MAPLATLONG: Was restricted to last plot being a map.  Relaxed this to
    allow quicklook maps that are more like xy plots.  RES
17 Feb 2005
  ANG_MEAN: New routine to find the mean of an array of angles.  Also
    returns the sdev if requested.  Intended to use for wind directions.
    Each is taken to be a vector (may give magnitudes for weighting),
    which are resolved into components.  The averaged components give
    a vector in the average direction.  Sdev is computed for deviations
    from the average direction.  RES
16 Feb 2005
  CHINIT: Added _EXTRA-extra to pass in keywords to the psinit.
    This allows /COLOR to be used for color PS plots.  RES
15 Feb 2005
  SECTOR_DEMO: Demo routine for the sector routine.  RES
  SECTOR: New routine to plot and fill a sector of a circle.  RES
  ARCS: Added new keywords: XOUT=x, YOUIT=y, PEN=p, to return the points

  RADII: Added new keywords: XOUT=x, YOUIT=y, PEN=p, to return the points
    on the plotted radii and the pen code to replot them using plotp.  RES
11 Feb 2005
  IWINDOW__DEFINE: Minor update of the image window object,  Just added
    a few keyboard accelerators to the zoom menu.  RES
10 Feb 2005
  STATION_MODEL: New routine to do metorology station model plots.
    This routine is not yet complete but it does wind barbs and
    cloud cover.  The symbol is constructed using turtle graphics.  RES
  RTURTLE__DEFINE: A new object to do turtle graphics in a relative
    coordinate system.  Define a turtle object by
      t = obj_new('rturtle')
    Display help by
      t->help
    One application of this  object is creating complex plot symbols such
    as windbarbs.  The plot symbol can be setup in a convenient standard
    coordinate system at a fixed scale and the relative coordinates used
    to shift, scale, and rotate to final symbol.   RES
9 Feb 2005
  RES_EXECUTE: New routine to deal with res files that contain data and
    IDL code.  Can execute the IDL code, or add or update code.  Code can
    access data from the res file.  May also pass in variables through
    keywords.  RES
3 Feb 2005
  RESOPEN: Made /QUIET apply to file already open message.
    Made this case a warning instead of an error and returned
    err = 0 (was 3).   RES
  RES_EXECUTE: New routine to process an executable res file.  An
    executable res file is a res file that has data and also IDL code
    under the tag IDLCODE.  The IDL code is a set of statements that
    get the data using resget and then process and/or display it.  RES
28 Jan 2005
  COUNTY_FIPS: Added notes with county names with FIPS by state.  RES
19 Jan 2005
  TAG_TEST: Added new keyword, INDEX=ind, to return index into structure
    where requested tag was found (-1 none).  Might be useful with
    substruct for extracting subsets of a structure.  RES
17 Jan 2005
  COMPLOT: Fixed to work for scalar values.  RES
14 Jan 2005
  MAP_SET_SCALE: Modified to take a mag factor to indicate the map has
    been displayed at a size other than the original.  Must pass in
    the map scaling info in this case since it will not be readable from
    the displayed image.  Can use INFO=info to pass it in.  RES
  SCREENPNG: Passed existing mag factor to map_set_scale (modified to
    deal with it).  For maps witrh embedded map scaling which is set by
    the map_set_scale routine.  This allows a map to be loaded larger than
    original size.  Data may be plotted and the map reduced back down to
    do antialiased plotting.  Reduce back to original size using averaging
    to preserve embedded map scaling (don't plot on the scaling info).  RES
13 Jan 2005
  COMPLOT: Added new keywords: /OVER to overplot points. /NOAXES
    to drop axes.  RANGE=r to set plot range for both x and y
    of [-r,r].  RES

    in a widget table.  Intended for scalar values only.  RES
5 Jan 2005
  GET_IDLPID: New funtion to return the Process ID of the current IDL
    session.  Only works for unix operating system families.  Useful to
    obtain a unique ID for each session of IDL, perhaps for a file name.  RES
4 Jan 2005
  HIST2D: Added new keyword OUT=out to return the axis info for the
    2-D histogram.  RES
3 Jan 2005
  DT_TM_TOJS: Upgraded to allow all numeric dates like 03/07/04.  Added

29 Dec 2004
  COMPLOT: New routine to plot complex points in the complex plane.
    Use like plot but give just z, a complex array, instead of x,y:
    complot, z.  All plot keywords work.  RES
21 Dec 2004
  RTURTLE__DEFINE: Added ANG=ang and /ABS to PLOT method.  RES
20 Dec 2004
  RTURTLE__DEFINE: Made oclr default to clr.  Also clipped polygons.  RES

    for the extension.  RES
1 Dec 2004
  IN_COMMON: New routine to return elements common to two given arrays.
    May also return elements not in common.  RES
12 Nov 2004
  KEPLER: Copied from another library.  Solves the Kepler equation
    for an elliptical orbit.  RES
  FACTOR: No longer backward compatible to IDL versions before 5.2 when
    ulong64 datatypes were introduced.  Was using execute to
    do conversion so the code would compile for older IDL versions
    but that doesn't work for IDL Virtual Machines so was commented out.
    Just move comment character or remove the ulong64 conversion
    line to make work for older IDL.  RES
  GET_ELLIPSOID: Embedded ellipsoid definitions directly in the code for
    this procedure instead of reading from a text file.  But used exact
    exact same layout in a text array to avoid any side effects.  Now
    should work for an IDL Virtual Machine.  RES
3 Nov 2004
  MAP_SET_SCALE: Was deleting current window when info array given.
    Fixed so that did not happen.  RES
1 Nov 2004
  TIFF2GIF: New routine to convert an 8 bit TIFF image to a GIF image.  RES
  PLOTSHAPE: Added DestroyEntity to clean up pointers in shapefile
    structures.  Also added labels.  Can now plot as text one of the
    atrributes (do check_shapefile to find one to display).  This is
    just a first cut and will break in some cases.  RES
28 Oct 2004
  RES_ADD_STRUCT: New routine to write a given unnested structure to a
    res file that is open for write.  RES
  RESPUT: Just made sure r_swap is defined.  RES
27 Oct 2004
  SHAPEFILE_PTS: Returned error flag.  RES
26 Oct 2004
  SHAPEFILE_PTS: Now returns, if requested, an array of CFCC =
    Census Feature Class Code as numeric values and the prefix
    of the class code (A for roads, H for hydro, ...).  These are
    the values needed to plot different roads and streams in different
    ways.  Will need to modify how they are plotted (maybe a modified
    version of plotp?).  RES
  MAP_SET_SCALE: Was giving wrong values when the map image was not
    on the screen but given through the IMAGE=img keyword.  A valid
    size window is needed by the IDL routine convert_coord.  Modified
    to create a temporary window when IMAGE=img is used.  Works.  RES
25 Oct 2004
  POLYFILLTR: Just added _eztra=extra to allow noclip=0 to be passed on
    to polyfillp inside.  This will then clip to the plot window.  RES
14 Oct 2004
  PATH: Now allows a leading + in path.  That means expand path to
    include all subdirectories that have *.pro files in them.
    May also give a list of paths to add but without the leading +.
    A list of paths with leading + will use only the first.  RES
  POLYFILLTR: Now takes pen code array to allow multiple polygons.
    Also added inverse option, like inverse of a selection.  Added
    outline plot (color and thickness), and solid fill.  RES
  POLYFILLP: New routine to fill multiple polygons when given given
    x,y, and pen code.  Pen code is 0 for pen up and 1 for pen down,
    one value for each polygon point.  RES
  POLYFILLTR: Added keyword /ILLUMINATE to do illuminated polygons.
    This is useful for darker maps or areas.  RES
12 Oct 2004
  INGEST_BINDATA: Just cleared up some items in the help text.  RES
  RESCOPY: Fixed to not read items that are to be ignored.  Also
    fixed comment problem.  RES
  RES_TO_STRUCT: Comments that included an = dropped everything from the
    = on.  Now fixed.  RES
11 Oct 2004
  RES_TO_STRUCT: Added new keywords.  /NOARRAY ignores all arrays in
    res file, none will be returned in the structure.  /ARRAY will
    return only arrays from the res file in the structure.  RES
  EQV3_LOAD_HELP: documented FLAGS in the equation file text.  RES
8 Oct 2004
  POLYFILLTR: New routine that does a transparent polyfill on the

  RESCOM: Added new keyword FD=fd.  See below.  RES
  RESCLOSE: Added new keyword FD=fd.  See below.  RES
  RESGET: Added new keyword FD=fd.  See below.  RES
  RESPUT: Added new keyword FD=fd.  See below.  RES
  RESOPEN: Added new keyword FD=fd to return a file descriptor.  Optional.
    FD allows multiple res files to be used at once.  This allows copying
    from one res file to another.  If FD is used in resopen make sure it is
    used with all the basic res file routines (routines operating on an
    open res file).  RES
  LIST_DOY: Added day of week to date listing.  RES
23 Sep 2004
  RES_TO_STRUCT: Added new keyword IGNORE=list to allow a list of res
    file tags to ignore and not read into the structure.  This can be use to
    avoid loading up large arrays when they are not needed.  RES
22 Sep 2004
  LIST_DOY: Reversed order to list latest on top, but added /reverse
    keyword, out=txt to return text, and /quiet.  RES
21 Sep 2004
  DATATYPE: The keyword /descriptor will give a description of a given
    value, listing the value if a scalar.  Just modified to list the value
    to more decimal places for doubles and floats and to convert a byte
    value to an int first.  This makes it more useful for listing
    tag, value pairs as mentioned in the help text.  RES
16 Sep 2004
  ROI_INDICES: Now can return polygon points.  RES
  LIST_DOY: New routine to list day of year for current and nearby
    dates (or for a given date).  RES

  PICKROI: New routine that allows regions of interest to be selected.
    There are 3 shapes available: box, circle, polygon.  A text array
    is returned with the shape type and parameters for each region of
    interest that has been selected.  The parameters may be used to
    find the pixels in the region by generating polygon points and using
    polyfillv.  RES
  XADJCIRC: Fixed a bug, was not returning center when keyword /new
    was used.  RES
8 Sep 2004
  LLSIGNED: Returned a signed value given a text string with a latitude
    or longitude with a N, S, E, or W (case ignored).  If no letter
    is in the text it is assumed to already be signed.  The text string
    is converted to a floating value with the correct sign.  RES
31 Aug 2004
  XLIST: Now displays size of list.  Only applies for /search with
    "Contains" option (/searth with "Starts with" option just repositions
    list.  If given text does not appear in any item then the full list 
    is displayed.  RES
30 Aug 2004
  XLIST: Upgraded the search option to search for text that either
    is at the start of a list entry or anywhere in a list entry.
    May switch modes back and forth.  May also send initial search mode
    and text.  RES
23 Aug 2004
  PRIME: Used ULL for bigger values.  RES

  XLIST: Added new keyword /SEARCH.  Jumps to part of list that starts with
    the text entered in the search area.  RES
28 Jul 2004
  GET_ELLIPSOID: Was not able to get a target ellipsoid if there were
    multiple matches.  Now checks # words to help match.  RES
27 Jul 2004
  DIMSZ: New function to return the size of the specified dimension
    of an array.  0 for nonexistant dimensions.  RES
  ALL_FACTORS: Fixed to work when there is only one prime factor.
    Was not working for that case (so primes and powers did not work).  RES

    shows the steps needed to do a datum shift.  RES
  CHECK_SHAPEFILE: Now lists how many entities are in the file and their
    type.  RES
13 Jul 2004
  XTXTIN: Added new keyword YSIZE=ysz to allow multiline text entry.
    If ysize used and > 1 then scroll bars are added and the 'Accept Entry'
    button must be used to exit.  RES

    2 letter state abbreviation and full name.  RES
7 Jul 2004
  ETC: Added /stop to internal call to timer so timing works as before.  RES
  TIMER: Modified to only update elapsed time on /stop keyword
    instead of keeping timer running.  Then a timer may be printed
    any number of times or the time returned any time with the
    same value.  Use /stop again to update to new elapsed time
    from last /start, or /start to reset to 0.  Also /reset resets
    a timer to zero.  It will stay zero until /start is used.
    This allows easier timing of sections of a routine.  RES
  ST2FIPS: New routine to return the 2 digit state FIPS code given a
    2 letter state abbreviation.  Like st2fips('pa') returns '42'.
    May also return full name.  Needs to text file st_fips.txt in
    same library directory.  This file is internally read using txtdb_rd.  RES
30 Jun 2004

    Same operation as the IDL rotate function.  RES
3 Jun 2004
  LOAD_COLORS: Increased gray scale area to 0 to 63 in color table.
    Now gray scale images may be displayed in Postscript with overlays
    in color.  Scale grayscale image to the range 0 to 63 after doing
    load_colors (in PostScript. epsinit,/color will do load_colors).
    Use color=tarclr(...) to set color of overlay.  RES
2 Jun 2004
  EPSINIT: Justed added to help text a note to loadct,0 after calling
    epsinit to display a true color image.  RES
  IMGUNDER: Fixed to work for Postscript true color images.  RES
  XVIEW: Fixed B&W PNG (no color table) to work.  If no color table
    found in PNG file makes a B&W color table.  RES
1 Jun 2004
  CSPEC: Made sure an integer division was done when computing freq
    even if specified number of points was floating.  RES
  EPSINIT: Minor change in default size.  RES
31 May 2004
  M_GET: Now returns a null string on error.  RES
  ZPAN2: Added new keyword MAGWIN=magwin.  This will return the window
    index of the mag window on exit and also allow it to be passed in
    for reuse.  If an existing mag window is used it must be the expected
    size (just don't change the size).  Use with keep to avoid the window
    being deleted and remade onmultiple calls to zpan2.  RES
28 May 2004
  CREATED: Added new keyword, /BY.  Returns text describing the routine that
    called created(/by).  Example:
	IDL routine: test.pro in /homes/sterner/idl/libs/idlusr/ on zero
    created() describes who and when, created(/by) describes which
    routine.  RES
  MAPLATLONG_GRID: Speeded up for images with a lot of pixels, like
    PostScript.  RES
  EPSINIT: Now only loads color table when /color used.  Else will default
    to the B&W (so images will work).  To use color overlays on a B&W
    image will have to load a custom color table and scale the image
    to fit the B&W part of the table.  RES
  IMG_WCLR: Fixed to work for a 24-bit target color.  RES
27 May 2004
  MAP_SET_SCALE2: Added new keywords OUT=out to return scaling info in
    a structure, and /NOSET to not actually set scaling.  Then can use
    map_put_scale with INFO=info and /NOEMBED to get scaling info in a
    byte array, and this routine to convert that byte array to a structure. RES
  MAP_SET_SCALE: Split out the map_proj_name function into its own file.  RES
  MAP_PROJ_NAME: New function to return name of map projection from code.
    Used to be part of map_set_scale.  Split off into its own
    file to use also in map_set_scale2.  RES
  EPSINIT: Revised to set a few useful defaults like axes and curve
    thickness.  Also loaded a color table with a wide range of colors
    so tarclr can be used to select a plot color.  RES
  LOAD_COLORS: New routine to load a standard color table with a wide
    range of colors.  Useful when working with 8-bit colors to use with
    the tarclr function to pick plot colors.  RES
24 May 2004
  TRAPI: New function to do trapizoidal integration, including
    cumulative.  RES
21 May 2004
  WINDOW_DRIFT: New routine to return the difference between a window's
    measured p[osition and the position where it was created.  This
    will cause a recreated window to drift if not accounted for.  RES
  ZPAN2: Added new keyword: /KEEP to keep mag window on exit.
    Also fixed window drift.   RES
20 May 2004
  TPRINT: Dropped call to execute to allow tprint to be used in
    an IDL virtual machine.  RES
  IMG_DISP: Added window index to default title and given title
    if /addsize used.  Not quite straight forward since this value
    is not known until after the window has been created.  RES
19 May 2004
  M_PUT: Very minor help text edit.  RES
  XVIEW: Was no setting scaling in some cases.  No sends image to
    set_scale call.  RES

    indicates center pixel and displays its coordinates (dev).  Also
    can give initial coordinates and returns coordinates of indicated
    pixel on exit.  RES
  MULTIBAND: New function to merge a multiband (or multichannel) image into
    an RGB color image.  The input is a 3-D array which is a stack of images.
    Also an array of hues, one for each component image, may be given and
    and array of weights for each component image.  Useful for multispectral
    images.  RES
16 May 2004

26 Apr 2004
  NEWSWEB: New routine to format newsletter articles into a web page.  RES
  FUTIL: Fixed a very minor typo.  RES
23 Apr 2004
  VUMOV: Now stops a running movie when open selected.  RES
  WRAP_PLOT: Demo routine to show a simple wrapper routine and how
    keywords may be passed to an internal call using the _extra
    keyword.  RES
22 Apr 2004
  VUMOV: Now sets device,decomp=0 and restores original decomp
    on exit.  RES
  WIN_SIZE_SHAPE: New routine to return the window dimensions needed to
    display a specified array with specified margins and a specified
    max displayed array side.  Mostly intended to be used with izoom to
    get a window that will fit the data to be displayed.  RES
21 Apr 2004
  VUMOV: Now allows a new text array named ID in the movie res file.
    If ID occurs in the file elements of it will display in place of
    time (if both occur).  The ID array can be very useful to show
    exactly which frame is being displayed.  Also now displays file
    name in title bar.  RES
19 Apr 2004
  FUTIL: New routine by Frank Monaldo to do system independent file
    operations like moving, copying, deleting, changing permissions.  RES
  PLOTSHAPE: Added noclip=0 to polyline and polyfill plot. RES
15 Apr 2004
  PLOTSHAPE: Added noclip=0 to outline plot.  Keeps in bounds.  RES
12 Apr 2004
  STK_LINREG: Just slightly changed help text.  RES
7 Apr 2004
  RESCLOSE: The addition of extended file pointer support broke the close
    for an XDR file when open for write.  To use the extended file pointer
    some data must be read from the front of the file, but an XDR file
    may only be open for read or write but not both.  Now a res file open
    for write is forced to use the short file pointer, the read is skipped,
    and the error is fixed.  RES
6 Apr 2004
  IMG_THICKEN: New routine to thicken a color in a 24-bit image.  RES
5 Apr 2004
  CHECK_SHAPEFILE: New routine to look at attributes of a shapefile and
    list all found and how many times they occur.  RES
  HASH_LIST: Added keys and values return and /quiet.  RES
  HASH_PUT: Fixed a minor typo.  RES
  PLOTSHAPE: Fixed loop limit to be long int.  RES
1 Apr 2004
  MAP_ARRHD: Moved from another IDL library to here.
    Plots an arrow head on a map.  Useful for indicating directions
    of tracks.  RES
  ELL_XYZ2LLH: Added /QUIET.  RES
  HASH_LIST: New routine to list all the keys in a hash table.  RES
  HASH_PUT: New routine to update a value or add a new entry to a
    hash table.  RES
  HASH_INIT: New procedure to set up a hash table given arrays of keys
    and values.  RSE
  HASH_STATS: New procedure to look at the statistics of a given hash
    table.  RES
  HASH_F: Default hash function for text keys.  Used by hash_init and
    hash_get to build and access a hash table.  Hash table users should
    provide their own hash function (hash_f.pro) that takes a given key
    and returns an index into the hash table that is in the range of the
    hash table size.  The default hash function simply totals the ascii
    codes of the characters in the key (key is assumed to be a text
    string).  RES
  HASH_GET: New function to get a value from a hash table given a key.  RES
31 Mar 2004
  RESTORE_NAMED: New routine to restore variables saved using save_named.
    The restored variables are named when restored so need not use the
    original names (which may not even be known).  RES
  SAVE_NAMED: New routine to save IDL variables in a way that they may be
    restored any a new name.   Use with restore_named.
    save2.pro is now obsolete.  RES
30 Mar 2004
  ZERO_INT: Added new keyword /NULL to return a null string if the
    argument is a string (instead of '0').  No effect on other data
    types.  Useful for initializing values or promoting values to a
    higher precision.  RES
25 Mar 2004
  TXTGETKEY: Added new keyword /NOSORT.  When using /STRUCTURE to return
    keyword/values in a structure by default the tag names are sorted first.
    Values of repeated tag names are returned in an array under that tag
    name.  The names are sorted so they may be anywhere in the file, and
    need not be adjacent.  To keep the tags in the same order as in the text
    file use the /NOSORT keyword.  As long as any repeated tag names are
    adjacent it will return those values in an array.  If they are not
    adjacent the routine will fail.  RES
23 Mar 2004
  BOX2B: Made small, locked boxes easier to grab (made area to grab 5 pixels
    bigger each way.  RES
  OUTBOX: Added new keyword EXPAND=ex.  Increases box size by ex pixels
    before testing if point outside.  This is useful to make it easier
    to grab a very small box when the size will not change.  RES
  VECFLD: Added _extra to allow plot keywords to be passed in.  RES
18 Mar 2004
  DAYGLOBE: Added satellite view option.  RES
16 Mar 2004
  WINLIST: Attempted to deal with pixmap windows.  They must be treated
    differently than normal windows.  For example, if the window position
    is requested from the device procedure pixmaps give an error.  Also
    don't want to return a pixmap for a size match request.  Could not
    find a good way to determine if a window is a pixmap so using
    help,/device for now until something better turns up.  RES
12 Mar 2004
  MAP_SET_SCALE2: Rewrote using _extra structure.  Should now be as
    general as the execute version (doesn't return all the listing info
    like the other version, this only sets the scale).  RES
  CLR2LUM: New routine to compute the luminance of a 24-bit color.
    Gives a value from 0 (min) to 255 (max).  May also give the keyword
    /bw to return black or white, which ever contrasts with the given
    color.  RES
11 Mar 2004
  SCREENPNG: Added option to use map_set_scale2 to avoid execute.  RES
  MAP_SET_SCALE2: Modified version to avoid the execute statement so this
    can be done in an IDL VM.  RES
  POINT: Added /NOFILL and /NOOUTLINE options.  RES
10 Mar 2004
  VECFLD: Just changed a few minor defaults.  RES
9 Mar 2004
  XCURVE: Fixed a long term bug in the erase when dropping points.
    Problem was that after the latest rubber band line was plotted
    the cursor may have moved.  Was saving the latest cursor position
    instead of the end of the last plotted rubber band line.  Now
    saves the point from the last plotted line so erase now works.
    Also step_min should work, fixed a problem there.  RES
2 Mar 2004
  RESCOM: Added new keyword GETLUN=lun to return the unit number of the
    current res file.  Does not do listing.  Useful when used with fstat
    to get the file size.  RES
1 Mar 2004
  COMPLEXVIEW: New routine to interactively display complex numbers in
    a small area of a complex image.  Assumes the complex image is displayed
    on the screen (full size).  Gives a small moveable box and displays
    a vector plot of the complex values in that box.  Updates as box is
    moved around.  RES
  PLEXVIEW: display a small complex array.  Intended as a change routine
    to box2b.  Used by complexview.  RES
  VECFLD: Upgraded and cleaned up a bit.  Also added new keywords X0
    and Y0 to give indices of lower left corner value.  Also increased
    tick label size a bit.  RES
26 Feb 2004
  PIMOD: New function to force angles to stay in the range -Pi to +Pi
    radians (or -180 to 180 degrees).  Can add an offset to an angle
    and then correct it back to the above range using pimod.  If angles
    are in the range 0 to 2*Pi or 0 to 360 then can keep in range using
    the mod operator.  RES
25 Feb 2004
  TXTDB_RD: Modified to allow either file name or text array to be given.
    Text array must have same format as text from a file.  RES
20 Feb 2004
  PH: Corrected to use the /phase keyword in atan.  It seems like atan used
    to work a bit differently.  Anyway, now the phase of a complex
    number (or array) is ph(z) and magnitude is abs(z).  RES
20 Feb 2004
  GETBITS: Fixed a typo found by Howard Taylor: had ulon instead of ulong.  RES
19 Feb 2004
  RESCLOSE: Modified to revert to old sytle header pointer when file
    closed so resfiles will work on old systems and even old res routines.
    Can force to use extended header pointer on close using the keywords
    /EXTENDED and /FORCE.  /EXTENDED will use the extended pointer if the
    file already used it, else it wil use the old if it can.  /FORCE will
    force use of an extended pointer (if IDL has long64 data type) even if
    that clobbers the first array.  If file originally used extended and
    then reverted to old style no harm will come from /force since space
    is already there.  RES
16 Feb 2004
  RESOPEN: Was not handling endian quite right.  Needed to check and correct
    endian before looking at file pointer.  RES
11 Feb 2004
  RESOPEN: Now supports big files.  RES
  RESGET: Now supports big files.  RES
  RESHDR_FROM_FILE: Now supports big files.  RES
  RESCLOSE: Now supports big files.  RES
9 Feb 2004
  VUMOV: Fixed a few problems, added an at end pause.  RES
5 Feb 2004
  SUNJS2: New version of sunjs that uses values given in Meeus Astronomical
    Algorithms.  Coefficient values given there have been used.  Good to
    about 0.01 deg.  Not much different from sunjs.  RES
  SUNJS: Added J2000.0 longitude.  RES
3 Feb 2004
  PRECESS_RES: Renamed from precess.pro to avoid conflict with the
    Goddard Astro lib routine.  precess_res is low accuracy.  Rewrote
    using Meeus in Astronomical Algorithms.  Not very precise.  RES
27 Jan 2004
  STK_LINREG: New routine to do a linear fit to columns in a stack of
    images (or 2-d arrays).  Uses IDL array operations, no loops.  RES
  GETFILE: Fixed to work in IDL as old as version 4.  uses findfile for
    older versions, file_search for new.  RES
22 Jan 2004
  XLINER: Fixed an undefined variable (wasn't always getting defined).  RES
19 Jan 2004
  AXIS2: Fixed a minor problem in the declutter algorithm.  Was using
    the max absolute value as the longest string, but now uses the
    longest of the min or max.  If min was -3000 and max was 3000 was
    pixking 3000, now picks -3000 as longest label string.  Working.  RES
15 Jan 2004
  MAP_SET_SCALE: Fixed a problem where the window current when map_set_scale
    was called gets lost.  Now saves it on entry and restores it on exit.  RES
14 Jan 2004
  AXIS2: Added new keyword /DECLUTTER.  If tick labels are touching or too
    crowded try this keyword.  It will spread the labels apart to try to
    avoid the clutter.  Seems to work.  RES
13 Jan 2004
  CROSSI: Added new keyword /HSV.  Use with /PIXEL to list pixel values
    as H,S,V instead of R,G,B.  RES
  ELLIPSOID: Added semiminor axis, b, to /current listing.  RES
9 Jan 2004
  IFWINDOW: New routine to create a specified window if it does not exist
    or is not of the specified size.  If the window does exist and is of
    the requested size just make it the current window (wset).  If
    size not given then window must just exist.  RES
  XLINER: Added built in routines.  RES
8 Jan 2004
  XLINER: Upgraded to allow any IDL library to be included in the
    search.  The library must use the standard IDL front end that
    documents each routine.  Then gen_alphone.pro may be used to
    make a one line description file for that library.  For more
   details do xliner,/addlibs.  RES
  GEN_ALPHONE: New routine to generate one line description files for
    routines in an IDL library.  Useful when used with xliner to find
    library routines.  RES
  XHELP: Added new keyword XSIZE=xs to handle width text strings.  RES
  FIX_RESLIB: New routine to process routines from my library to slightly
    modify the line of dashes before the front end documentation
    template so doc_library will work.  RES
7 Jan 2004
  SUNALTAZI: Fixed a minor bug that came up for multiple values.  RES
6 Jan 2004
  IMG_MAP_IMAGE: Was returning result when /NODISPLAY option used but
    not when it wasn't.  Now fixed.  RES
30 Dec 2003
  XLIST: Fixed a minor typo in the help text.  RES
29 Dec 2003
  MAPGCI: Default endpoints was not working, fixed.  Also added a bit of
    help text (* marks active endpoint).  The !map structure had changed,
    should now be working.  RES
15 Dec 2003
  LEG: Added new keywords /DEVICE, /NORMALIZED to allow legend position
    (POSITION=pos) to be in device or normalized coordinates instead of
    always the default normalized window coordinates.  Normalized window
    coordinates are 0 to 1 in x and y inside the plot axes.  This is
    often a convenient coordinate system to work in, but not always.  RES
11 Dec 2003
  XLIST: Added new keyword /MULTIPLE to allow multiple items to
    be selected.  First try didn't work, as many others have found out.
    A web search turned up Robert Mallozzi's dialog_list.pro which
    gave some very useful clues.  My routine is a bit redundant but
    is used in other of my routines so was useful to keep and upgrade.  RES
9 Dec 2003
  TXTDB_RD: Was doing a strcompress,/remove_all on each item before
    converting to requested data type.  Now does strtrim(txt,2) instead.
    This preserves spaces inside strings.  RES
4 Dec 2003
  CW_DSLIDER: Just added some help text on returning floating values.
    If initial value given make sure it's a float.  RES
24 Nov 2003
  MAP_SET_SCALE: Fixed image size error detection.  RES
11 Nov 2003
  TNAXES: Some time intervals gave porr time axis labels.  Tracked down
    to the use of the I$ format which is for a time interval, not a
    time axis.  Changed to use 'n$ 0d$' instead.  Also adjusted when
    day number kicks in for time intervals of a day or so.  RES
  NAXES: Found a case (fairly rare) where the returned value of ndec was
    not integer.  Found and fixed the problem.  RES
10 Nov 2003
  FAST_MAP: Allowed map colors to be changed.  Also added map options
    like Hi-res on/off, USA on/off.  RES
4 Nov 2003
  DAYGLOBE: Fixed to work for Postscript device.  Also added new
    keyword, /FINE, to use higher res for the sun colors.  RES
30 Oct 2003
  IMG_MAP_IMAGE: New routine to do map_image for a 24-bit color image.
    map_image only works for 2-d images.  RES
29 Oct 2003
  SUNCLOCK: Fixed to work for 24-bit color displays (does device,decomp=0). RES
  DAYGLOBE: Fixed to work for 24-bit color displays (does device,decomp=0). RES
  RADEC2LATLON: New routine to find the point on earth directly beneath
    a given RA, Dec.  Useful for makig a map showing the side of earth
    facing this point in the sky.  Depends on time.  RES
  JS2GRA: From UT JS find RA for Greenwich meridian (radians).  This is
    useful for finding the sub-object longitude.  Also revised help
    text.  RES
  RADEC2ALTAZI: From a celestial object's RA, Dec compute Azi,Alt.  Also
    need time and observer location.  Moved from idlsat.  RES
  ALTAZI2RADEC: From a celestial object's Azi,Alt compute RA, Dec.  Also
    need time and observer location.  Moved from idlsat.  RES
28 Oct 2003
  XLINER: Now can save the help text displayed when a listed routine
    is clicked on.  RES
  XHELP: Minor help text change.  Was confusing the librarian routine.  RES
27 Oct 2003
  VERI: fixed the same initial line problem as for crossi (oct 09).  RES
  HORI: fixed the same initial line problem as for crossi (oct 09).  RES
  XADJCIRC: Tried to clarify the help text.  RES
22 Oct 2003
  FIT: Added /YNOZ to plots linear in Y to better show the plot.  RES
17 Oct 2003
  ELLIPSOID: Added a new keyword, IDL=ell, to set an ellipsoid as used in
    map_set as the working ellipsoid.  RES
  MAP_SET_SCALE: Fixed a difference in computed pixels/degree when
    image array was given but not displayed.  convert_coord
    needs a window to work correctly and it must be the correct size.
    A pixmap window was created for this purpose, then deleted. Also
    added central pixel to returned structure and rounded the coordinates
    of the computed image window.  RES
16 Oct 2003
  XLINER: New widget routine to search the one line description files given
    a list of keywords.  If a line contains all the keywords it will
   be listed.  Clicking on a routine description will display its
   built-in help.  RES
10 Oct 2003
  GETFILE: Fixed an error when no lines in file.  RES
9 Oct 2003
  CROSSI: Finally tracked down a long term problem that left a vertical
    line on the image.  Was due to not rounding after converting to device
    coordinates, the conversion gave fractional values.  Seems to be fixed
    now.  Also added a new feature, XYPRO, an optional procedure that
    takes the x,y coordinates and does something.  An example is to
    make a procedure, test.pro, that is initialized with a list of
    longitudes and latitudes and place names.  This is done before sending
    to crossi.  Then if crossi is used on a map the x,y values are longitudes
    and latitudes.  If xypro='test' is given to crossi (after it has been
    initialized) then it could compute the distances of all items in its
    list and if close to one display the name.  The procedure can be
    written to take a keyword, /init, and a list of keywords and values, like
    lat=lat, lng=lng, name=name.  For example:
	test,/init,lat=lat, lng=lng, name=name
	crossi,xypro='test'
    The crossi call could also return the button clicked for exit as part
    of a larger program.  RES
7 Oct 2003
  FIT: Same fix as below.  Also minor plot upgrades.  RES
  FIT6: Changed sign for Yoff for exponential fit.  Was not working
    right when using a Y offset.  Also added fit listing with numeric
    values.  RES
24 Sep 2003
  SCREENPNG: Added /IWIN option to display an image in an iwindow.  RES
  MAGBUB__DEFINE: Fixed to work for B&W images.  RES
  IWINDOW__DEFINE: Fixed zoom area reset to reset char size.
    Fixed problems in the list and zoom resize.  RES

    test image.  RES
23 Sep 2003
  IWINDOW__DEFINE: New IDL object: image window.  Resizable window
    with a selection of functions such as image save, scale, zoom.
    Uses a mag-bubble for zooming.  RES
23 Sep 2003
  MAGBUB__DEFINE: Bubble Magnifier.  Just copied latest version.  RES
  IMG_ICE: Added error flag.  RES
  IMG_SCALE: Fixed minor help text typo.  Also added error flag.  Fixed
    case of do last interactive scaling when none exists.  RES
  XHELP: When using the SAVE=file option the help text used to advise
    to also use the /WAIT option.  This does not work and was dropped.  RES
22 Sep 2003
  MAP_PUT_SCALE: Added an error flag to indicate that map_set2 not used.  RES
19 Sep 2003
  MAPRINGS: Minor change to purpose text to help find this routine.  Also
    fixed color, thickness, linestyle to allow each ring to have its
    own values.  RES
16 Sep 2003
  MAP_SET_SCALE: Added an error flag to easily find if embedded scaling
    info is available.  RES
12 Sep 2003
  STR_CLIPTRAIL0: Just added comments to explain what it's doing.  RES
9 Sep 2003
  PLOTSHAPE: Added shape file type 3 = polyline.  Also added
    THICK=thk,LINESTYLE=lstyl and downloaded Appalachian Trail shape
    file and plotted on the big Chesapeake Bay watershed map.  RES
8 Sep 2003
  PLOTSHAPE: Copied this routine from the development directory:
    /homes/sterner/idl/libs/dev/shape_files
   Still under construction but does polygons well.  Added a new keyword
   /DEVFILL that converts polygons from data to device coordinates
   before filling.  polyfill sometimes had a glitch, not always
   repeatable (varied with scale) but this seemed to work.  RES
  ERASEWIN: New routine to erase the plot window only (not the
    whole image).  Must have a plot window.  Can give color.  RES
5 Sep 2003
  DATA_SEGMOD: New procedure to deal with timeseries like data that has
    values that wrap modulo some constant, like angles.  Returns the
    start and end indices needed to access each continuous segment
    of the data.  RES
4 Sep 2003
  GETFILE: Fixed an error in dealing with the number of lines in a
    file.  Error slipped in when line count was automated.  RES
3 Sep 2003
  TXTDB_RD: Now allows * or ; as data type for a column of values to
    ignore that column (not added to structure).  This allows labels
    for each row of data.  RES
2 Sep 2003
  TXTDB_IN: Renamed from txtdb_in.pro.  RES
  TXTDB_RD: Renamed from txtdb_rd.pro to keep set of routines together
    alphabetically.  RES
2 Sep 2003
  GETFILE: Now checks if file exists first.  RES
29 Aug 2003
  DETAB_FILE: New routine to convert tabs in a text file to spaces.
    May also list file showing tabs and how it would appear after
    being detabbed (without changing it).  Useful with rd_txtdb.  RES
  RD_TXTDB: Minor changes.  Cleanup up help text.  RES
28 Aug 2003
  RD_TXTDB: Upgraded to allow multiple header/data blocks in the
    text file.  RES
27 Aug 2003
  DATE2JD: Better error checking.  RES
  YY2YYYY: Added a check for input<0.  RES
  RD_TXTDB: Added tab handling, also debug mode.  RES
  DETAB: Upgraded to allow text arrays.  RES
  SHOWTABS: New routine to show tabs in a text array as a specified
    character (def=#).  RES
26 Aug 2003
  RD_TXTDB: New routine to read a data base in a text file into a
    structure.  Do help,rd_txtdb(/help) for details.  Makes it easy
    to set the structure tag names and data types and allows headers
    and trailers.  RES
26 Aug 2003
  TYP2NUM: Upgraded to allow abbreviations for data types.  Also allowed
    string data type. Fixed problem with L64, UL64 types.  RES
20 Aug 2003
  RESHDR_FROM_FILE: New routine to update a RES file header from
    text in a text file.  When used with RESHDR_TO_FILE these routines
    allow a RES file header to have comments or scalars added, and the
    order of header items changed.  Be careful not to change data types
    or locations of array items or data may be lost.  RES
  RESHDR_TO_FILE: New routine to put a copy of a RES file header in
    in text file.  RES
  RES_FROM_STRUCT: New routine to write a RES file from an unnested
    IDL structure.  Can include RES file comments by including items
    in the structure with tags like _COMM001 and values with the
    comment.  RES
  RES_TO_STRUCT: New routine to read a RES file into an IDL structure.  RES
18 Aug 2003
  SUBSTRUCT: New function to extract a sub-structure from a structure
    given the structure and indices of items to extract.  The indices
    are the item positions within the structure, the first is 0, next is
    1, and so on.  RES
4 Aug 2003
  ROUNDN: New function to round to a specified number of decimal places.
    The number may be < 0 to round to multiples of powers of ten.
  May also return the result as a string.  Works for scalars or
  arrays.  RES
29 Jul 2003
  MAGBUB__DEFINE: new IDL object to deal with displaying an area of
    an image magnified as the mouse is moved around.  May use a
    smooth transition from the unmagnified part of the image to the
    magnified.  RES
  XADJCIRC: New routine to adjust a given set of circles for size
    interactively on in an image window.  Must give a list of radii,
    these may be changed by dragging with the mouse.  RES
10 Jul 2003
  XGETVALS: Fixed case for defaults given as byte values.  Also
    now allows non-numeric defaults.  Set input focus to
  OK button.  RES
9 Jul 2003
  IMG_SCALE: New funtion to scale a given image using various
    options.  Works for 2-d (BW) or 3-D (color) images.  RES
8 Jul 2003
  LS: Added new keyword NBINS.  RES
  SCREENTIFF: Was not displaying a TIFF image correctly so
    modified to use img_disp for display.  RES
18 Jun 2003
  NDIM_INDICES: New routine to dealing with N-dimensional tables or
    nested loops.  For a given set of indices into a table (or starting
   indices of nested loops) can compute how many cells are before the
   indicated cell and how many after (inclusive).  Same as the number of
   times the innermost code has been completed or has yet to complete
   for nested loops.  This can be useful for restartable code to know
   how many iterations to expect.  RES
13 Jun 2003
  SW_SHOWPT: New routine to position a scrolling window to display
    a given point. RES
  WIN_INFO: New function to return useful info fora graphics window.
    Especially useful for scrolling windows, returns visible area size
    andcoordinates of visible area.  RES
2 Jun 2003
  TXTPUTKEY: Write out a structure as a keyword/value pair.  Approximate
    inverse of txtgetkey (write out to file instead of text array).  RES
30 May 2003
  IMAGE_AREA_GET: New routine to get an image working area that was set up
    by image_area_set.  Useful for processing a selected area of
    an image.  RES
  IMAGE_AREA_SET: New routine to set an image working area.  Like a
    selection box.  Can pick box interactively in window, or
  specify its limits.  Saves area in a text file, one entry for each
  size image.  May specify the name of the text file to use.  May
  list its entries.  RES
23 May 2003
  AADEMO: Routine that demonstrates how to use the antialiase
    routines.  RES
22 May 2003
  RADON2: Just renamed the old radon function to avoid a name
   clash with IDL's radon.  RES
  MAPRINGS: New routine to plot distance rings on a map.  One use is
    to show map distortion.  May plot multiple rings. Interactive
    mode if center not given.  RES
  TXTGETKEY: Now allows comment character, *, to be first
    non-blank character.  Before had to be in column 1.
   Null lines are ignored and comment lines, so no cleanup
   may be needed to access a setup or control file.  The entire
   set of keyword/values may be returned using the structure
   option.  RES
16 May 2003
  CROSSI: Added new option to display a value from a 2-d array
    based on a screen plot.  Data coordinates of cursor on screen
    is used  to pick value from 2-d array.  Must give crossi the
    2-d array and also the x and y coordinate arrays.  New keyword
    is IZOOM=iz where iz is a structure: iz={x:x,y:y,z:z).  Example:
	z = makez(300,200)
	x = maken(10,20,300)
	y = maken(1000,1500,200)
	izoom,x,y,bytscl(z)
	iz = {x:x, y:y,z:z}
	crossi,izoom=iz,/mag
    Somewhere in the example image should values of 0 and 1.  RES
  IMAGE_ALIGN: Someminor upgrades.  Use green instead of blue.
    Allow second image to be smaller than first and vary offset
    into it.  RES
13 May 2003
  LINI: Cleaned up some minor items: added a delay for the mag window
    toggle, positioned help widget better and made go away when
    lini is exited.  RES
  MAGCRS: Added true color.  Automatic, so routine that use magcrs
    should not need changed.  RES
8 May 2003
  AXIS2: The axis title can overlap tick labels for left and right
   titles and ticklabelsthat extend beyond axis.  Added code to
   shift the title if crowded, but only works for horizontal axes.
   Automatically disabled for any other axis angle.  Can maybe
   generalize at some point but will need to modify textplot to
   do that.  RES
2 May 2003
  INGEST_BINDATA: Corrected the default FITS comment length to 48.  RES
  DISTANCE_SCALE: Made units label offset bigger.  RES
23 Apr 2003
  AXIS2: Made title offset smaller.  RES
  DISTANCE_SCALE: Made units label offset smaller.  RES
  XVIEW: Added PNG image display.  RES
21 Apr 2003
  IMG_DISP: Can now look back multiple windows to find a matching size
    window to use.  Just use current=n.  Also can now add image size
    to a given title using /addsize.  RES
  WINLIST: Added new keywords to return window sizes and positions.  Also
    added keywords to return index of window that matches a given size,
    -1 if no matches.  Can also give how many windows to look back so
    can say to match only last two windows for example.  RES
18 Apr 2003
  FILELISTS: Returns lists of files in current directory where lists are
    specified by subtrings within the file names.  This is not a very
    general routine but is made to be fairly fast, especially for
    unix/linux.  The initial full list of files can be narrowed down by
    prefiltering on a given substring.  The substring is specified by
    giving the starting character and length and a string to match at
    that position.  The prefiltered list can then be divided into up to
    8 sublists in a similar way.  RES
8 Apr 2003
  WAIT_BAR: New routine to wait specified number of seconds.  Shows an
    indicator bar giving fraction of wait done.  Can use in place of
    wait when a progress indicator is useful.  RES
2 Apr 2003
  IMG_DISP: Revised to always use an swindow.  This will allow the title to
    be changed, the position, and so on.  See help for details.  RES
  SWINDOW: Major work on the window scrolling size.  Works better now when
    given a scroll size of 0 for an axis.  Also added GET_SCROLL=scr to
    return scroll sizes that would be used but without actually making
    the window.  This allows other routines (like img_disp) to compute 
    a screen position for the scrolling window.  RES
  SWINFO: Minor help text edit.  RES
26 Mar 2003
  CW_BITLIGHTS: Added new keyword /STRIP to give a horizontal strip
    of lights.  Can with or without labels depending on space.
    May also show value represented by the bits but only in /STRIP mode.
    Can give a format for that value.  Need not have all the lights
    needed to display the full value.  RES
25 Mar 2003
  TIFFSCREEN: Updated for 24-bit color.  RES
24 Mar 2003
  CW_MCLED: Minor tuning to make a bit more compact.  RES
  CW_STRIPCHART: Now may set a new legend image at any time after
    widget is realized.  Just use widget_control, id, set_val=img.
   The incoming value is examined, if 3-d it is assumed to be a
   24-bit image, else it is assumed to be new plot values.  RES
21 Mar 2003
  CW_STRIPCHART: Changed the Options button to read Help to make
    things a bit more compact.  RES
20 Mar 2003
  CW_STRIPCHART: Minor tuning.  RES
  GET_COUNT: Added new keyword /LAST to return the last count for a given
    tag.  Does not increment tag, may call any number of times with
    no change to the count file.  RES
18 Mar 2003
  CW_MCLED: New compound widget to emulates a multicolor LED.  Give
    list of colors and labels to go with them.  Then just use
    widget_control to set a value to the status number: 0=off,
   1=status 1, ...  RES
  STR_CLIPTRAIL0: Complete rewrite.  Now searchs for first place where
    decimal fraction of all values is 0 and returns one less place.  RES
17 Mar 2003
  SWINDOW: Cleaning scrolling: if no scroll bar is needed on either axis
   then no spcae is set aside for scroll bars so looks like an ordinary
   window.  If one axis needs a scroll bar then by default both will have
   them.  If the scroll size of the axis not needed a scroll bar is
   set to 2 pxixels bigger than the size of that axis then the scroll
   bar will not appear.  For exaple: swindow,xs=1500,ysize=100 gives
   two scroll bars, but swindow,xs=1500,ysize=100,y_scr=102 gives
   only the Y scroll bar.
     Also added the new keyword GROUP_LEADER to set a group leader.  When
   the group leader widget is killed all the widgets in that group are
   also killed.  The widget ID of the scrolling window is returned in
   the INDEX=in keyword as the second value.
   Does not work for large windows with two screens.  Window doesn't get
   wider than the first screen, but thinks it is, so is wrong.  RES
14 Mar 2003
  CW_STRIPCHART: Some major upgrades.  Now can click to change y scale.  RES
  NEW_RANGE: New function to find a new range from a current range.  A mag
    factor gives a new size.  Can give mag<1 to expand a range.  Can limit
    range to given values.  Useful for changing plot x and y ranges.  RES
13 Mar 2003
  WIDGET_GETOFFSET: New routine to get screen position of a subwidget
    whose widget ID is given.  Ofen the subwidget will be a button.
    This allows pop-up windows to be created close to where they are
    called up.  RES
  DIGITS_PUT: New routine that combines a given array of digits
    into a number.  RES
  DIGITS_GET: New routine that returns an array with the digits in a
    given number.  RES
  IMG_DISP: Added new keywords: XPOS=x, YPOS=y, X_SCR=xsc,
    Y_SCR=ysc.  Allows window positioning and sizing.  RES
  MAKE_WINDOW: Added new keywords: XPOS=x, YPOS=y.  Allows window
    positioning.  RES
12 Mar 2003
  CW_STRIPCHART: Now uses /no25 for horizontal axis.  Also allows
    fewer channels to be plotted than setup.  RES
  AXIS2: Added /NO25 keyword.  RES
  NAXES: Just fixed some missing text string quotes.  RES
  NICENUMBER: Added new keyword /NO25 which means do not return
    multiples of 2.5.  Like the same option in naxes.  RES
5 Mar 2003
  CW_BITLIGHTS: Added a minor dark halo around light for noglare
    case.  Upgrades appearance.  RES
  CW_STRIPCHART: Minor help text change.  No longer refer to minutes
    for x, but x units.  They can be whatever.  RES
4 Mar 2003
  PATH: Fixed a minor problem, on remove an item a leading : was
    included.  RES
27 Feb 2003
  PATH: Cleaned out comented code.  Upgraded error feedback.  RES
13 Feb 2003
  STDDEV2: 
13 Feb 2003
  MEAN2: Added keywords /DOUBLE and /NAN like the total function.  RES
4 Feb 2003
  LS: Now lists value when given image is constant.  That's less
    confusing when a black image is displayed.  RES
3 Feb 2003
  FIT6: Cleaned up quotes around text.  RES
  FIT: Cleaned up quotes around text.  RES
29 Jan 2003
  PATH: Fixed a problem with adding a new directory to the path.  Was
    incorrectly checking if it was there.  Also clarified the details
    on removing items from the path.  String matching is done, so must
    be careful to give exactly what is intended.  For example, if items
    with the string map are to be removed, this will include things like
    ...map, ...map2, and so on.  To remove just the first and not the
    second, give more info, like map$ to anchor it to the end of the line
    if that's where it is.  RES
28 Jan 2003
  HIST: Bug fix by Mary Keller dealing with number of bins.  RES
23 Jan 2003
  VNORM: New function to normalize a given array from 0 to 1.
    Can give optional scale and offset.  Makes it easy to plot
    arrays in specified positions.  RES
  MEAN2: New function to average over a given dimension.  Works like
    total but for means.  RES
21 Jan 2003
  CBAR: Added new keywords: /KEEP_SCALING, XSAVE=xs, YSAVE=ys, PSAVE=ps
    to keep the color bar x/y coordinates, but return the original plot
    coordinates.  This makes it easy to plot items related to the color
    bar or dependent on the color bar coordinates, like labels for regions
    of the color bar (ex: ok, caution, danger).  If cbar called last for a
    plot then the original scaling may not need restored.  If it does, use the
    XSAVE, YSAVE, PSAVE keywords to have those values returned.  To reset old
    scaling do !x=xs & !y=ys & !p=ps.  RES
20 Jan 2003
  WAVELENGTH_TO_HUE: New routine to return an array of hues corresponding to
    a given array of wavelengths in Angstroms.  Also returns an array of
    saturations.  Intended to help generate an image of a spectrum.  RES
17 Jan 2003
  INGEST_BINDATA: Added TOT_BYTES to return total bytes needed by the given data
    description.  Can use that to get an initial structure that can be used to
    directly read the data from a binary file (in /CHECK mode):
	t is a text array containing the data description.
	txt = ingest_bindata(t,/check,tot_bytes=nrec,/quiet,comment=cmt)
	s = ingest_bindata(t,bytarr(nrec))			RES
16 Jan 2003
  RCPLOT: Now allows an X range to be given.  Will display a smaller
    length of the current row or column around the cursor position.  RES
  HISTPLOT: Made update on move be default.  RES
  READM: Unformatted equivalent to the formatted reads routine.
    Don't know how to read directory from memory yet, so wrote
    data out to a file, then read it in.  RES
15 Jan 2003
  COLOR: Fixed to work without using the obsolete color conversion
    routines.  RES
14 Jan 2003
  IMAGE_STATS: Fixed a problem where sdev will not compute for data type
    uint, just added 0. to float it.  RES
9 Jan 2003
  XGET_IMGDSC: New widget routine to collect information about a simple
    image file.  Can select an offset to image, image size, and image
    type.  RES
6 Jan 2003
  FILE_SEARCH2: New routine to replace findfile2 for IDL 5.5 or greater.
    Handles large lists better.  RES
  GET_COUNT: Switched from findfile to file_search if the version of
    IDL is 5.5 or greater (file_search was added in IDL 5.5).  This was
    done because findfile was clobbering a buffer used in a call external,
    the problem was tracked down as far as findfile but couldn't be
    tracked further.  RES
23 Dec 2002
  PATH: Generalized the remove option to allow regular expressions.
    Can use to greatly reduce size of !path.  Also now path alone
    works like path,/list.  RES
  STRFIND: Added new keywords: /INVERSE to return items that do NOT
    contain the given substring, and COUNT=cnt to return how many
    items matched given substring (or did not match for /INVERSE).  RES
18 Dec 2002
  PATH: Modified so if an item is already on the path it will not
    be added again.  RES
17 Dec 2002
  CW_DSLIDER: Was clobbering window 0, now fixed.  RES
  EVENT_LOG: Made unspecified dir be a null string.  Was failing when
    setfile was given as a full path.  Now should work.  RES
16 Dec 2002
  EVENT_LOG: Fixed a dir problem.  Was not writing to given dir but
    in current dir instead when set was used.  RES
4 Dec 2002
  BITEXPLODE: New routine that takes the bits in a byte array and
    splits them into individual bytes.  RES
3 Dec 2002
  GET_COUNT: When count file did not exist, or a new tag was requested,
    the count was returned as '1', not formated using DIGITS.  Now fixed. 
    Also made tag optional.  If not given it defaults to $.  RES
27 Nov 2002
  MAP_SET_SCALE: Fixed a minor error in map_set_scale,/list,
    std_par was mispelled.  RES
21 Nov 2002
  TAGS_MATCH: New routine to compare the tags of two structures
    to find matches.  Useful if unique tags are needed.  RES
20 Nov 2002
  INGEST_BINDATA: Cleaned up the check and lencheck modes to work with
    the new comments added yesterday.  RES
19 Nov 2002
  INGEST_BINDATA: Now may include in the data description text, lines of
    text to include in the resulting structure.  These lines may then
    be detected and used elsewhere.  The text to include has a + in the 
    first column.  Such lines will create tags in the structure of the
    form ___$nnnn where nnnn is a 4 digit number like 0000 (or 0001, ...).
    These might be later translated into something else, like COMMENT in
    a FITS header for example.  RES
  WORLD_SUNZD: Modified to allow JS to be given.  RES
18 Nov 2002
  IMG_PLOTP: Now gives an error message if not called with img, x, and y.
    Before could try to call with img, y only but nothing happened.  RES
14 Nov 2002
  CW_MAGIMAGE: Now allows set_val='red=1', reduction factor to be set.
  CW_BITLIGHTS: Darkened the off lights a bit.  Also allowed non-integer
    values to set_val.  Added /noglare and /pack.  RES
13 Nov 2002
  CW_STRIPCHART: New compound widget that displays a moving stripchart.
    Can plot multiple tracks.  RES
  CW_MAGIMAGE: New compound widget that displays an image and a magnified
    view of a selectable area.  Can update image and magnified view
    just by setting a new value.  Useful to deal with images larger
    than the screen.  RES
  CW_BITLIGHTS: New compound widget that gives lights that may be
    turned on or off by giving a bit pattern or an array of 0s and 1s.
    Light colors may be given.  Use widget_control to set a new light
    pattern.  RES
12 Nov 2002
  IMG_ADD: New routine to add two 24-bit color images.  RES
  SWLIST: Now weeds out non-existant swindows.  So you can kill swindows
    with no problem.  Before they were recognized but still listed.  RES
11 Nov 2002
  TVRD2: Upgraded to allow an image to be given instead of reading from
    screen.  Still allows position to be outside or partly outside
    image.  Useful for scrolling around an image that is displayed
    smaller than actual size.  RES
5 Nov 2002
  AXIS2: Corrected for some minor roundoff problem that sometimes made the
    axis endpoint too small.  RES
4 Nov 2002
  DRAW_WID_CORR: IDL draw widgets do not always have the requested
    scroll size.  If this matters use this routine to find the correction
    needed to get the desired size.  The correction appears to be the
    same for any size window.  With some more experimentation it was
    found that the corrections are not exact, they seem to over correct
    a bit.  Not sure how to get the scroll size to exactly cover a
    requested amount.  RES
31 Oct 2002
  UNPACK12: Correct to work on both big and little endian systems.  RES
30 Oct 2002
  UNPACK12: New function to unpack 12-bit data into 16-bit uints.  RES
  SWAP_NIBBLES: New function to swap the upper and lower 4 bits in a byte
     or byte array.  RES
29 Oct 2002
  IMGARR_VIEWER: New routine to view an array of images.  Images may be non-byte
    and need not be scaled 0 to 255.  Several scaling options may be selected
    in the display widget.  The images may be displayed as a movie or single
    stepped through using a slider bar and/or single step buttons.  RES
  XOPTION: Fixed problem of switching windows when using COLORS.  RES
28 Oct 2002
  LINER: New routine to look for routines in IDLUSR given keywords.  RES
  XHELP: Added 3 new keywords, TID=tid, TTID=ttid, and /SCROLL.  These will now
    allow new text to be displayed in the text area using widget_control
    at a later time.  Also the size of the text area can be changed in the
    same widget_control call to better match the new text.  RES
25 Oct 2002
  EQV3: Switched to using cw_dslider to give drag events on Windows IDL.  RES
  IMAGE_ALIGN: Interactive image alignment.  RES
24 Oct 2002
  EQVC: Added a bit more to the default equation.  More plot colors,
    overlay colors, colored the initially active sliders.  RES
24 Oct 2002
  EQVC: Latest update.  RES
23 Oct 2002
  XOPTION: Added new keyword COLORS=clr to display a small color
    patch beside each button optionally.  RES
  GRID: Now uses SHRINK keyword to ver and hor to avoid
    overplotting axis ticks.  RES
  HOR: Added new keyword SHRINK=shr, see below.  RES
  VER: Added new keyword SHRINK=shr  Factor to shrink vertical
    range of data lines.  Used in grid.pro to avoid overplotting
    the axis tick marks.  RES
22 Oct 2002
  EQVC: Added colors to equation file, also init text.  Also
    added color editing for multiple plot and overlay colors,
    and snapshot save for colors and init text.  RES
  INGEST_BINDATA: Added LENCHECK=maxlength to check length of tag
    names and flag tags longer than a max length.  Also now returns
   an array of comments for each tag.  RES
21 Oct 2002
  COLOR_PICK: Fixed some minor problems.  Added C24 listing.  RES
18 Oct 2002
  GRID: New routine to make it easy to add an xy grid to a plot.  RES
17 Oct 2002
  EQVC: Added overlay plot commands.
  COLOR_PICK: Now shows markers for incoming color.  Also starts new
    color at old color.  RES
  C2HSV: New routine to convert a 24-bit color value to hue, saturation,
    and value.  RES
  INGEST_BINDATA: New routine to extract a block of binary data into
    a structure.  The binary data is contained in a byte array.  A
    description of it is in a string array, one line for each item
    in the binary data.  Details given in the routine help text.  RES
15 Oct 2002
  GETBITS: Added new keyword /REDUCE to reduce the returned datatype
    to the minimum containing the requested number of bits.  The
    default is still to return the same data type as given.  The
    data type is not based on the value of the extracted bit field, that
    would cause problems using structures, data types would vary.  RES
  TYPEXTRACT: New routine to extract a specified data type from a byte
    array of binary data.  May extract scalars or arrays.  Data type is
    specified in a text string.  RES
13 Oct 2002
  EQVC: Latest version of eqv, more compact and should work for
    Windows IDL.  RES
  COLOR_PICK: New widget to pick a 24-bit color.  RES
11 Oct 2002
  TYP2NUM: Added /QUIET.  RES
10 Oct 2002
  TYP2NUM: New routine, roughly the inverse of datatype.  Useful
    for adding up total size of a list of known data types.  RES
  DATATYPE: Now returns number of bits for non-integer numeric
    data types.  Keyword not changed since it's used elsewhere.  RES
7 Oct 2002
  EQVD: Added win_redirect and win_copy to eliminate flicker.  Also
    added user specified plot window size.  RES
  ELL_LOXODROME: A bug was fixed that gave negative range when the
    latitudes were equal.  This was found by Rick Chapman when he ported
    it to the Palm.  Still has other problems going out of range.  RES
6 Oct 2002
  EQVD: EQV modified to use new cw_dslider.  The regular widget_slider
    does not generate drag events for Windows and Macs, this slider
    should do that.  RES
  CW_DSLIDER: new compound widget, slider bar using a draw_widget.
    Generates drag events, should work for Windows and Mac.  Not
    exactly same syntax as widget_slider but close.  Right now always
    does drag events, also no value displayed.  RES
6 Oct 2002
  C_ADJHSV: New function to adjust the H,S,V values of a given 24-bit
    color.  One use is to find shadow and highlight colors.  RES
1 Oct 2002
  STRFIND: Made /quiet suppress string not found message.  RES
25 Sep 2002
  GET_COUNT: Modified to allow SET=# for new tags.  This makes it easy to
    start at 0.  Also added new keyword DIGITS=n to give fixed length
    output values (like 00017).  RES
23 Sep 2002
  RCPLOT: Minor refinements.  RES
  HISTPLOT: Minor refinements.  RES
  IMAGE_STATS: Minor refinements.  RES
22 Sep 2002
  BOX2B: Fixed a minor xor problem with change routines.  RES
  NUMPLOT: New routine that uses image_numbers to display interactive
   image numbers.  RES
  IMAGE_NUMBERS: New routine to be used as a change routine to box2b.  Displays
    image numbers in a 10x10 box.  numplot.pro uses this routine as a change routine to
    box2b.  RES
  XBB: Added new keywords XOFFSET, YOFFSET, to position widget.  RES
  HISTPLOT: Can now position plot window.  RES
  IMAGE_STATS: Can now position plot window.  RES
  RCPLOT: Added optional controls for mag window position, plot window
    position, and plot window size.  RES
  MAGCRS: Added new keywords XPOS, YPOS to position mag window.
    Note the widgets are positioned using X/YOFFSET from upper
    left corner (for Linux IDL), windows are positioned using
    X/YPOS from lower left corner (for Linux IDL).  RES
  SWINDOW: Added new keywords XOFFSET, YOFFSET to position window.  RES
19 Sep 2002
  HISTPLOT: New routine that uses image_stats to plot interactive
   image histograms.  RES
  XGETVALS: New widget routine to get user entries in labeled fields.
    Easy to use and customize.  May later allow area to be grouped into
    sections (by allowing title text to be given a row to appear above,
    def=1).  RES
  BOX2B: Cleaned up the menu area.  RES
  PATH: Now can give a string to FRONT to move a directory to the
    front of the path.  This is better than position number.  The
    string is actually a regular expression.  So for example if the
    following are on the path: abc3, abc2, abc, to move abc to front
    use FRONT='abc$' where $ means the end of the line (see IDL's
    regular expressions for more details).  This can help deal with
    unavoidable routine name clashes.  Also added /INIT to capture the
    current path to be reset by the /RESET keyword.  RES
18 Sep 2002
  IMAGE_STATS: New routine written to be used as a change routine to
    box2b.  Can display a histogram and image stats for a subarea
    defined by a selectable box.  Also can snapshot plot to a JPEG
    image.  histplot.pro uses this routine as a change routine to
    box2b.  RES
  BOX2B: Change routine added, see box2b,/ch_details for info.
    Can give a routine to execute on every box change or move.
    An example routine is image_stats.pro, which plots a histogram
    and some stats, also allows a snapshop of plot.  RES
  TVBOX: Added /XMODE to do XOR mode boxes.  RES
17 Sep 2002
  BOX2B: Fixed a problem that didn't erase the initial box if it started
    defined.  New boxes were ok, but returning boxes didn't erase if a
    corner were moved.  Now fixed.  Also found and fixed a move error
    after button was released.    RES
10 Sep 2002
  RCPLOT: New routine to plot rows or columns of an image.  RES
  XMESS: Fixed /wait to work right.  RES
  RCPLOT: New routine to plot image rows or columns.  Interactive
    in current image window.  May give array on which image is based.
    Gives a zoom window around cursor.  RES
9 Sep 2002
  MAGCRS: Got to work for XOR mode.  RES
  VLINE: Added empty to avoid some minor artifacts visible along edges
    of the image.  This cleared it up completely.  RES
  HLINE: Same as above.  RES

  VLINE: Added /XMODE and /RESET keywords.  RES
  HLINE: Added /XMODE and /RESET keywords.  Can now work in
    XOR mode so should be faster.  RES
  SWINFO: Added new keyword /VIEW to find corner of visible area
    of window.  Can use to find window center very easily:
    swinfo(101,/view)+swinfo(101,/vis)/2.  RES
  XMESS: Centered the OK button.  RES
  XTXTIN: Added new keywords: /ROW and MBLAB=lab.  /ROW puts
    optional MENU buttons in a row instead of a column.  This is
    useful if the button labels are short.  MBLAB=lab lets the
    menu button label be changed from the default "-".  Use a
    single char, maybe just a space.  RES
5 Sep 2002
  HLINE: Fixed bug that prevented last line from being erased.  RES
  MAGCRS: Upgraded to deal with horizontal or vertical lines.  Also
    returns horizontal or vertical image data.  RES
  CROSSI: Added new option, ARRAY=array.  If an array is given then
    it's value at the mag window center is listed in the display
    widget.  The array must match the screenwindow size and /device
    coordinates must be used.  RES
  MEAN: Dropped this function since IDL has one of the same name and
    purpose.  Should be transparent.  RES
3 Sep 2002
  MAPGCI: New routine to interactively draw a great circle on the
    current map.  Must have a map displayed made using map_set.  RES
16 Aug 2002
  EVENT_LOG: The SETFILE option to use a specified log file name was a
    bit rough.  Also got errors when the standard event file names were
    in same directory, mixing date and non-date file names.  Cleaned all
    that up.  Also now gives init text for new setfile files.  RES
15 Aug 2002
  AATEXT: Now requires 3 args to run.  RES
14 Aug 2002
  SWSHAKE: New routine to shake an swindow.  Do swshake,/help.  RES
  SWINFO: New routine to return requested info about a scrolling window.
    Makes it easy to scroll the window to specified positions.  RES
  SWLIST: Updated to match swindow.  RES
  SWDELETE: Updated to match swindow.  RES
  SWINDOW: Upgraded.  Dropped some old unused code.  Now keeps track of
    and can return the draw widget ID to allow easy scrolling of the
    window under computer cntrol.  RES
13 Aug 2002
  MS2JS: New routine to convert from Microsoft internal time (64-bit,
    unsigned integer, UT) to local time in Julian Seconds.  RES
31 Jul 2002
  MAP_SET_SCALE: Added true central lat and long. This can differ from the
    values given to map_set if the limit keyword is used.  New values
    are both listed and returned in the structure.  RES
29 Jul 2002
  XORPLOT: New routine to plot a changing curve in a screen window.  Uses
    XOR mode to plot a curve and erase last one.  Keeps last curve
    internally.  RES
26 Jul 2002
  TEXTPLOT: Added new keyword /ANTI to do antialiased text.  RES
25 Jul 2002
  AATEXT: Added alignment as an allowed array.  RES
  IMG_TEXT: Added alignment as an allowed array.  RES
24 Jul 2002
  XCURVE: Fixed mag window for 24-bit color.  Still has an erase problem.
    Check if rubber band erased before erasing last segment.  Also
    check if empty needed after each plot to fluch graphics.  RES
  AATEXT: New allows charsize and orientation to be arrays. RES
  IMG_TEXT: New allows charsize and orientation to be arrays.  This may
    allow faster results by combining multiple text outputs as long
    as the size and thickness are the same for all.  RES
  AADEMO: first run sometimes had a red background.  Made a small
    temp window, erased it, and deleted it, to init graphics.  RES
  IMG_POINT: Had to add empty to flush graphics buffer, was not plotting
    point outline on some systems.  RES
23 Jul 2002
  AADEMO: Demo of aa* = antialiase routines.  RES
  AAPOINT: Added /NOAA, no antialiase mode.  RES
  AAPLOTP: Added /NOAA, no antialiase mode.  RES
  AAPLOT: Added /NOAA, no antialiase mode.  Also handle single arg.  RES
  AATEXT: Added /NOAA, no antialiase mode.  RES
22 Jul 2002
  IMG_PLOTP: Nows does not give error if plotted item is outside area.  RES
  THICKEN: Added new keyword /QUIET to suppress non-serious errors.  RES
  IMG_ICE: Added save last scaling option.  On later calls to img_ice, if
    the Save/Restore buttons active, then the Restore button will have
    Last as the first restore option.  It will give same scaling as in
    effect on last normal exit (OK button).  RES
19 Jul 2002
  XTXTIN: Fixed a minor bug and cleaned up code a bit.  RES
18 Jul 2002
  IZOOM: Added antialias option, but not yet for JS.  RES
17 Jul 2002
  XTXTIN: Added optional flags (check boxes).  RES
16 Jul 2002
  AAPLOT: New routine to do antialiased plot command in current window.
    Works pretty much like the plot command but does not erase first
    and is slower.  But it looks good.  Useful for final plots
    for presentations.  RES
  AAPLOTP: New routine to do antialiased plots type commands in
    current window.  Actually works like the plotp command in this
    library.  Does not clip to plot window by default.  Also linestyle
    may not work too well with antialiasing.  But can give symbols and
    set their size, and give the curve thickness.  Slower than plotp
    but looks good.  RES
  AATEXT: New routine to do antialiased text in current window.
    Works pretty much like the xyouts command.  Slower but looks good.  RES
  AAPOINT: New routine to do antialiased points in current window.
    Works pretty much like the point command in this library.  Slower
    but looks good.  RES
  PLOTP: Upgraded to clip for any coordinate system.  Also discovered
    that plots and even oplot doesn't clip to plot window in the z-buffer,
    even using noclip=0.  Found a work-around, works if given an explicit
    cliping window using the clip=... keyword.  But the clipping window
    must be in the same coordinates used for plots so must set up one of
    3 cases.  Seems to now be working.  RES
  IMG_PLOT: New routine to do an x/y plot on a 24-bit image with
    optional antialiasing.  Doesn't need X windows running,
     uses the Z buffer.  RES
15 Jul 2002
  IMG_TEXT: New routine to plot text on a 24-bit image with optional
    antialiasing.  Doesn't need X windows running, uses the Z buffer.  RES
12 Jul 2002
  IMG_POINT: New routine to plot points on a 24-bit image.  Works like
    point but plots on image and can antialias.  RES
  IMG_PLOTP: New routine to plot curves on a 24-bit image.  Works like
    plots with the added feature that curve breaks can be specified
    using an optional pencode (1=plot from last point, 0=break curve).
    Also can plot with antialiasing which greatly reduces jagged curves
    due to pixels.  RES
  PLOTP: Added new keywords: THICK, PSYM, SYMSIZE.  RES
11 Jul 2002
  IMG_WCLR: Dropped keyword CLR and used COLOR instead.  RES
  IMG_CLRW: Dropped keyword CLR and used COLOR instead to be more
    standard with other routines.  RES
  IMG_RESIZE: Simplified code.  Also added /REBIN option to use
    rebin instead of congrid.  This is very useful for reducing an
    image by averaging.  RES
3 Jul 2002
  MAP_SET_SCALE: Added map x and y size in pixel to returned structure.
    Also map start x and y for tvrd().  RES
1 Jul 2002
  TXTGETKEY: Upgraded to allow repeated keywords with the structure option.
    Now returns an array for any repeated keywords with /structure.  RES
28 Jun 2002
  XHELP: Added XOFFSET=xoff, YOFFSET=yoff.  RES
27 Jun 2002
  ZWINDOW: Modified to work when starting in Z device mode.  RES
26 Jun 2002
  IMG_SPREAD: Fixed to work for single channel.  RES
  JPEGSCREEN: Used new routine get_visual_name to make this routine
    independent of X.  RES
25 Jun 2002
  GET_VISUAL_NAME: New routine to get the visual class name in a
    device independent way.  The built-in device procedure gives an error
    if the current device does not support get_visual_name.  Useful for
    writing software that can run both in X and the Z buffer.  RES
  DECOMPOSE: New routine to get or set the value of decompose in a
    device independent way.  The built-in device procedure gives an error
    if the current device does not support decompose.  Useful for
    writing software that can run both in X and the Z buffer.  RES
  ZWINDOW: Another try to make work without X windows.  Now does not
    do anything with decomposed unless plot device is set to
    X, MAC, or WIN.  Still does for the /copy command but that won't
    be run unless on one of the above.  RES
  TARCLR: Help text now mentions inverse routine is c2rgb.  Also modified
    to allow /hsv in a single string argument.  This makes it easy to
    allow r,g,b or h,s,v color formats in setup files.  RES
  IMG_CLRW: Now allows a single 24-bit color value to be given,
    not just a 3 element array [r,g,b].  RES
  IMG_ICE: Added optional channel labels.  Display in widget title
    bar when channels are changed.  RES
  XTXTIN: Added yet another set of extra buttons.  This set looks
    and acts more like the normal command buttons (OK, CLEAR, CANCEL).  RES
24 Jun 2002
  IMG_ICE: Added Save/Restore scaling state to allow Undo/Redo.  RES
  IMG_SPREAD: Fixed a minor problem in img_spread.  Was only dealing
    with missing data on the red channel, now does all channels correctly. RES
21 Jun 2002
  IMG_SPREAD: Added HIST=hst option to do histogram scaling to
    spread the values.  RES
  LS2: A new, more general version of ls.  For small integer data types,
    byte, int, uint, the result is scaled to the full data range.  For
    other non-complex numeric data types the result is scaled to
    0 to 255.  These are the defaults and may be overridden.  RES
18 Jun 2002
  IMG_CLRW: Fixed to handle BW (1 channel) images.  RES
  IMG_ICE: Added default save name.  Also now lists channel marker
    x,y position to allow exact positioning.  Also found and fixed
    the problem where the window was not deleted on exit.  RES
  JPEGSCREEN: Now allows saving a jpeg from the z buffer.  RES
14 Jun 2002
  XTXTIN: Now allows custom labels for the 3 main buttons.  This will
    allow programs to be more clear.  RES
13 Jun 2002
  BASECON: Extended operational range by using long64 instead of long.  RES
  IMG_SPREAD: New routine to spread image values over entire range
    that data type supports.  Works for Byte, Int, Uint data types.
    So for example, if a UINT color image is given with the red values
    ranging from 1000 to 2000, green from 800 to 1200, and blue from
    blue from 1100 to 2200 then the image values from 800 to 2200 are
    rescaled to range from 0 to 65535.  The main purpose of such an
    operation is to make it easier to scale an image using img_ice, the
    values of interest will not be so tightly bunched so the adjustment
    will not be so sensitive.  Note however, that the scaling structure
    returned by img_ice applied to the spread image, so if applied to another
    size of the image do img_spread first.  RES
  ENTER: Dr. Jenny Lovell, CSIRO Earth Observation Centre,
    Canberra, Australia fixed a bug in testing if input was numeric.  RES
12 Jun 2002
  IMG_CE: Do a contrast enhancement on given image using given
    values returned by img_ice.  This arrangement allows processing
    non-byte images such as INT and UINT.  The other allowed datatype
    is BYT.  It also allows a small version of an image to be scaled
    interactively, and that scaling applied to a large version of the
    image.  RES
  IMG_ICE: Interactive Contrast Enhancement.  Allows stretching of
    image R,G, and B components.  Returns scaling values needed to
    process the image, doesn't actually modify the image.  Use
    img_ce to do that.  RES
  XHELP: Minor help text fix.  RES
11 Jun 2002
  IMG_DISP: Now allow INT and UINT images.  These have the same format
    (3-d, interleaved) but are non-byte data type.  img_disp does not do
    tvscl, so for images should cover the full data range (-32768 to 32767
    for INT, 0 to 65536 for UINT) for best results.  This will allow
    some data images to be viewed easily.  RES
  SWDELETE: Added a missing return.  RES
6 Jun 2002:
  Documented timer object that was in the library but not mentioned here.
    To use: t=obj_new('timer') & t->help    RES
5 Jun 2002
  SWLIST: Fixed to deal with non-existent windows.  If a scrolling
    window was deleted manually (clicking on the x) it is now handled.
    It's still in the list but cannot be clicked.  An swdelete of it
    will remove it from the list.  RES
  SWDELETE: Fixed to handle scrolling or normal windows.  RES
5 Jun 2002
  IMG_DISP: Had to deal with 8-bit palette images (like GIF) if smag
    option used.  Can't just smooth the 8-bit image, must smooth
    RGB components.  RES
4 Jun 2002
  IMG_SHARPEN: New routine to sharpen a 24-bit image.  RES
  SHARPEN: New routine to sharpen a given image.  Just returns result.
    Almost same as tvsharp but does not display result.  RES
  IMG_DISP: Added MAG and SMAG keywords to change displayed image size.
    SMAG does a smoothing before changing size (if reducing).  RES
  IMG_SMOOTH2: Does multi-pass box smoothing of 24-bit images.  RES
  IMG_SMOOTHC: Renamed from previous img_smooth.  Does convolution
    smoothing of 24-bit images.  Much slower than img_smooth2.  RES
  IMG_SMOOTH: Revised to do simple IDL box smoothing.  RES
  IMG_ROTATE: Minor help text upgrade.  RES
  IMG_ROT:  Minor help text upgrade.  RES
  IMG_SUBIMG: Minor help text upgrade.  RES
3 Jun 2002
  IMG_DISP: New routine to display specified image.  May give image
    array, 2-d or 3-d, or image name as a string.  RES
  IMG_ROT: New routine to rotate a 2 or 3-d image by any angle.  Same
    features as the IDL rot routine.  RES
22 May 2002
  SCALEARRAY: Minor help text upgrade.  RES
  LS: Now allows SCALE_ON to be a 2 element array, min and max to scale
    to 0 and 255, in addition to another image array.  RES
  CPOSPRINT: Added translation of invisible characters.  Currently only does
    tab, but easy to add others.  IDL's strmid function counts tabs as
    single characters, now cposprint will accurately give positions useful
    for strmid.  RES
  PNGSCREEN: Just removed the period at the end of the filename listed after
    image is saved to allow it to be swept up with mouse.  RES
20 May 2002
  POLYSTAT: Just made for loops use long ints.  RES
  IMG_INSIMG: Rewritten.  RES
7 May 2002
  IMG_SMOOTH: Fixed minor typo in help text.  RES
8 May 2002
  ELL_POLYGON: New routine to take a set of points defining a polygon on
    an ellipsoid and fill in the sides with small steps.  There are two
    common ways to connect points on an ellipsoid with "straight lines",
    geodesics (great circles on a sphere), or loxodromes (lines of
    constant azimuth).  Both are used, sometimes together in the same
    polygon.  This routine allows the line type for each side to be
    specified.  The main intention of this routine is for calculating
    areas on an ellipsoid.  Can use ell_cyl_eq_area to compute area
    once ell_polygon fills in the sides with small steps.  RES
7 May 2002
  ELL_CYL_EQ_AREA: New routine to compute the area of a long/lat polygon
    on an ellipsoidal earth.  Converts to an equal area projection.  RES
6 May 2002
  D2DMS: Fixed another roundoff error.  RES
  ELL_XYZ2LLH: Same as below.
	Also add to ELL_LOXODROME, ELL_MERC, ELL_RB2LL, ELL_LL2RB.  RES
  ELL_LLH2XYZ: Added back in the removed keyword ELLIPSOID.  This is
    in addition to using the ellipsoid routine to set up the working
    ellipsoid.  Now either way can be used.  The keyword is more
    convenient for datum shifts since the ellipsoid structures can be
    set up ahead of time and used in the calls.  RES
1 May 2002
  AXIS2: Added TDELTA keyword to set Labeled tick spacing in data units
    instead of pixels.  Also added /NOMINOR to inhibit minor ticks.  RES
  ELL_LOXODROME: Generalized the ellipsoid.  RES
  ELL_MERC: Generalized the ellipsoid.  RES
  ELL_XYZ2LLH: Generalized the ellipsoid.  RES
  ELL_LLH2XYZ: Generalized the ellipsoid.  RES
  ELL_RB2LL: Generalized the ellipsoid.  RES
  ELL_LL2RB: Generalized the ellipsoid.  RES
  ELLIPSOID: New routine that will return the current working
    ellipsoid structure.  Also can set the working ellipsoid.
    The ell_* routines will be modified to get the ellipsoid using
    this routine, then they can work with any ellipsoid.  RES
  GET_ELLIPSOID: Minor fix to error flag.  RES
29 Apr 2002
  MAKES: Had to replace the call the string with stringform, my routine
    to get around the IDL string limit of 1024 array elements.  RES
28 Apr 2002
  D2DMS: Found a roundoff error when using frac=f.  Should be fixed.  RES
  ELL_LOXODROME: Fixed help text.  Also cleaned up to allow some array
    values to be used.  Not completely general for array values since
    internal formulae are complicated and it is working very well as is.
    Mostly intended to allow a line to to run by giving an array of
    distances.  RES
26 Apr 2002
  D2DMS: Cleaned up the deg and sec symbols and also added optional
    fractions of second.  RES
  GET_ELLIPSOID: Fixed a minor output structure tag typo.  RES
  DMS2D: Now allows dd:mm:ss form.  Can have fractions on seconds.  RES
25 Apr 2002
  LS: Fixed help text typo.  RES
24 Apr 2002
  STRFIND: Added keywords INDEX=in, /QUIET.  INDEX returns the indices
    into the text array that contain the search string.  RES
23 Apr 2002
  SCALEBAR: A simple graphical indicator showing the total possible data
    range for an  image, the actuall range of the image values, and the
    range used to scale a displayed image.  Gives a quick indication
    on if the image has been highly stretched for example.  RES
  SCREENPNG: Minor bug fix for small images (looked for embedded scaling
    even when image was too small).  RES
22 Apr 2002
  STRFIND: New routine to list lines of a text file that contain a given
    regular expression.  Uses IDLs stregex, but lists lines and indices
    into text array.  RES
18 Apr 2002
  GET_ELLIPSOID: New routine to return an ellipsoid structure for
    a requested ellipsoid.  Need to add more ellipsoids.  RES
  STR_DROP_PUNC: New routine to drop all punctuation from a given
    string or string array.  Useful for comparing strings.  RES
  ELL_XYZ2LLH: Can now give an ellipsoid to use, defaults to WGS 84.  RES
  ELL_LLH2XYZ: Can now give an ellipsoid to use, defaults to WGS 84.  RES
16 Apr 2002
  MAKE_WINDOW: New routine to make a window.  Just give x and y size,
    it decides if to use a regular window or a scrolling window based
    on given window size compared to screen size.  RES
15 Apr 2002
  AXIS2: Added /NOLABELS.  Also had to deal with major and minor ticks
    not quite lining up in some cases.  Made some values double precision,
    seems to be working so far.  RES 
  IMGUNDER: Rounded screen window coordinates to avoid 1 pixel image
    placement errors.  RES
  ALL_FACTORS: Returns an array of all factors of a given number.  Number
    of factors returned is numfactors(n)+2 since 1 and n are included.  RES
11 Apr 2002
  SCREENJPEG: Added MAG, ERROR, PIXMAP, WINDOW keywords.  RES
10 Apr 2002
  ELL_LOXODROME: New routine to deal with loxodromes on an ellipsoidal
    earth (WGS 84).  Given 2 points can compute the loxodrome azimuth
    and loxodrome distance (m).  Given a start point, loxodrome azimuth,
    and loxodrome distance can compute the end point.  RES
  ELL_MERC: Added new keyword, SCALE=sc.  Default scale is 1, so all
    returned x,y are in meters at full size.  RES
9 Apr 2002
  ELL_MERC: New routine to deal with the Mercator projection on an
    ellipsoid.  Does both forward and inverse transformations.  That
    is, x,y from long,lat, and long,lat from x,y.  RES
  MAP_OUTINE: Plot outline of a given map on the displayed map.
    Maps must have scaling info embedded by map_put_scale.
    Useful for making an index map showing other smaller maps.  RES
  FAST_MAP: New routine to quickly make an IDL map with colored
    water and filled continents.  Orthographic projection, hard coded.
    Colors hard coded.  RES
  MAP_SPACE: New routine to set points inside map window that are not
    actually on the map to white.  Intended for orthographic projection
    maps (globes).  Only changes to white inside the map window, not the
    whole window.  RES
5 Apr 2002
  SCREENPNG: Added /PIXMAP option to use a pixmap window.  convert_coord
    needs a window size, see next entry.  RES
  MAP_SET_SCALE: Had to handle window size for the case where the image
    was pass in (not read from the screen).  Any current window may not
    be related in size to the image, use the image itself as the window
    size.  Note there may be other issues when doing convert_coord from
    device to data coordinates.  convert_coord really needs to reference
    a window to do this conversion and will use any current window even
    though it may not be the right size.  Will need to make sure current
    window is correct size before doing the above convert_coord.  RES
3 Apr 2002
  SCREENPNG: Fixed to work for IDL 5.3 and above.  5.3 reads png image
    wrong, flipped in y.  So both read and write of PNG in IDL 5.3 was
    wrong.  RES
  GIF2PNG: Fixed to not flip image if IDL version is above 5.3.  RES
2 Apr 2002
  MAP_SET_SCALE: Added new keyword COMMAND=cmd to return all info needed
    for the original map_set2 command used to creat the map with the
    embedded scaling info.  RES
1 Apr 2002
  AXIS2: A more general axis routine.  Can give the axis angle.  RES
29 Mar 2002
  IMGUNDER: Upgraded to work for 24-bit color images.  Still works for
    8-bit images.  So now izoom also works for 24-bit color images.  RES
  IMG_INTERPOLATE: New routine to do interpolate on 24-bit color images.
    also works for 2-d images.  RES
25 Mar 2002
  WORDPOS: Mewly rewritten.  Now works with word index number or character
    positions and allows offsets and case ignore.  Useful for picking
    text strings apart.  RES
  HEXDUMP: Added to the help text how unprintable characters are
    displayed.  RES
22 Mar 2002
  LASTCHR: Added new keyword /REMOVE to remove a given last character
    if it is there.  RES
18 Mar 2002
  MAP_GET_BYTES: New routine to get the extra info embedded in an image
    that was added by map_put_bytes.  RES
  MAP_PUT_BYTES: New routine to add extra info to embedded scaling byte
    array.  All the info is added to the image using map_put_scale.  RES
14 Mar 2002
  SCREENPNG: Added new keyword MAG=mag.  Can use to make thumbnail images.
    May be 2 elements: [magx,magy].  RES
7 Mar 2002
  AZTICK: New function to format tick mark labels that are azimuths.
    The values are kept in the range 0 to 360.  To use just add to the
    plot call: ...,xtickform='aztick',...
    Can turn the formatting on or off by using a string variable for
    the formatting function, substitute a null string for no formatting.  RES
  POINT: Now rounds symbol positions to nearest pixel.  Was giving slightly
    distorted symbols rarely.  This seems to fix that.  RES
5 Mar 2002
  BUILD_ARR_STRUCT: New routine to take an array of tag names and
    an array of values and create a structure.  Since the values are
    given in an array they must all be the same type.  Text strings
    are perhaps the most useful, since numeric text strings can easily
    be converted to numbers.  Useful for ingesting a control file into
    a structure.  RES
4 Mar 2002
  PNGSCREEN: Added a work around an IDL v5.3 PNG bug.  Tests which
    IDL version and saves correctly.  RES
  SCREENPNG: Added a work around an IDL v5.3 PNG bug.  Tests which
    IDL version and loads correctly.  RES
25 Feb 2002
  PNG2JPEG: New routine to convert images from PNG to JPEG.  RES
22 Feb 2002
  TEXTPLOT: Added new keyword OFFSET=offset.  This does an along text
    offset by characters.  OFFSET=1 offsets the text along its length
    by 1 character, like adding a space at the front.  OFFSET=-1
    offset the opposite way.  Use X alignment of 0:
    ...,align=[0.,.5],offset=1,...
    The alignment keyword applies the the whole length of the text, so
    what works ok for single characters is way off for long strings.
    This keyword should fix that problem.  Note  that the offset is
    actually in Ms, the width of the letter M in the current font.  RES
18 Feb 2002
  PATH: Added new keyword REMOVE=n to remove the n'th directory
    (as listed by path,/list).  RES
11 Feb 2002
  PLOTSH: Now allows /device and /norm.  RES
10 Feb 2002
  DISTANCE_SCALE: Moved labels a bit closer to axis.  RES
  MAP_SET_SCALE: Added pixels/degree at map center to returned
   structure.  RES
  MAPLATLONG_GRID: Dropped BASE=base keyword.  No longer needed since
    margins for all 4 sides are now returned.  RES
  TEXTPLOT: Added new keyword: /NOPLOT that does not plot text.
    Useful for finding size of text before plotting it.  RES
8 Feb 2002
  SCREENPNG: Now calls map_set_scale with color=0 so map border is not
    overwritten.  RES
  MAP_SET_SCALE: This routine plots the map border in general, not sure
    how to stop that --- can't just do /nobord, that changes the scale.
    But a new keyword was added, COLOR=clr, to allow color to be set.  RES
7 Feb 2002
  MAPLATLONG_GRID: Added new keywords: /NOPLOT and MARGINS=m.  When called
    with these the margins needed around the map window to contain the
    labels are returned in pixels.  Make sure to use the same CHARSIZE
    as will be used for the actual map grid.  RES
4 Feb 2002
  DISTANCE_SCALE: New routine to plot a distance scale.  Intended for
    maps.  Optionally show scale for two units, like miles and km.
    Knows several distance units and how they relate.  RES
  NAXES: Just fixed some typos in the help text.  RES
  XYOUTB: Modified default font to !p.font (instead of -1) to allow
    the use of TrueType font.  RES
1 Feb 2002
  PLOTSH: New routine to plot data curves with a drop shadow. Helps
    curves stand out over a complex background.  RES
30 Jan 2002
  D2DMS: Allowed input to be an array.  RES
  DMS2D: Allowed input to be an array.  RES
  MAP_SET_SCALE: Now adjusts map_set scale so same area will be covered
    even when window size changes.  RES
  MAPLATLONG_GRID: Now allows XDELTA and/or YDELTA to be set to 0 to
    indicate autogrid spacing.  Also fixed a problem dues to minor
    roundoff error.  RES
29 Jan 2002
  MAPLATLONG_GRID: Was picking the wrong label positions sometimes,
    should be fixed now.  RES
  MAP_PROJ_TEXT: Added altitude to satellite projection info text.  RES
  MAP_SET_SCALE: Added CLIP=0 flag.  RES 
  MAP_SET2: Added CLIP=0 flag.  RES
28 Jan 2002
  MAP_SET_SCALE: Restore map scaling from info embedded in the map image.  RES
  MAP_PUT_SCALE: Embed map scaling info collected by map_set2 into the
    currently display map.  Must use map_set2 to do this.  RES
  MAP_SET2: A simple wrapper for map_set, works exactly the same, just
    passes all args on to map_set.  But it picks off all info needed
    to define the map setup.  This info may be embedded in an image
    using map_put_scale.  When the image is loaded for display the
    routine map_set_scale can be used to restore the map projection
    and scaling.  This allows such maps to be reused without having to
    regenerate them, after loading positions may be measured and data
    added to them.  RES
24 Jan 2002
  STR_CLIPTRAIL0: Found some cases that didn't work and fixed them.
    This was integers and numbers with 0s after the decimal place but
    with non-zero digits after.  RES
  MAPLATLONG: Fixed the SPACE keyword to return a structure with the
    info needed to deal with off map points.  See builtin help for
    an example on using it.  RES
  MAPLATLONG_GRID: Made label spacing depend on which side of window.
    Also added optional label ticks of adjustable size.  RES
23 Jan 2002
  MAPLATLONG_GRID: Just dropped messages from routines used inside.  RES
22 Jan 2002
  MAPWINDOW: Cleaned up listing.  RES
  MAPLATLONG: Now returns indices of points off the map.  RES
  SCREENPNG: Fixed for latest map_set_scale.pro.  RES
21 Jan 2002
  MAPLATLONG_GRID: Added new keyword BASE=base to return the device
    coordinates of the bottom of the bottom side labels.  Useful for
    spacing other text below bottom side of map.
>>>===> There is a big flaw in MAPLATLONG_GRID: the label separations,
    sep and sep2 should be based on which side of the map is being labeled,
    not on lat or long.  This will come up for rotated maps for example.
    Should be easy to fix.  RES  <===<<< fixed.
  MAP_PIXDEG: New routine to return the scaling at the map center in
    pixels/degree. by default the north/south scale is returned.
    Can request the east/west scale.  If /ISO was used in the map
    command they should be very close.  RES
  SWINDOW: Added new keyword VIEW=[ix,iy] to position viewport within
    scrolling window.  By default viewport shows upper left part of
    the full window.  Giving VIEW=[0,0] for example shows the lower
    left corner of the window.  RES
15 Jan 2002
  MAP_PROJ_TEXT: return text array describing map projection.  RES
  STR_CLIPTRAIL0: New routine to help format a small array of values.
    Values are typically floating point.  Will return a string array
    of the values formatted to have the same number of decimal places,
    all the same, equal to the max needed.  For example, [63.00000,
    -149.500, 0.00000] are returned as ['63.0', '-149.5', '0.0'].  RES
14 Jan 2002
  TIMER__DEFINE: New object, an elapsed time timer.  Set up a timer
    object as: t1 = obj_new('timer').  Has the following methods:
	t1->time     List elapsed time since timer start.
	t1->reset    Restart timer.
	t1->get, dt  Get elapsed time in seconds.
        t1->help     Help on using this object.
    Timer starts when object is created.  The timer object allows
    timing multiple events.  RES
13 Jan 2002
  SCREENPNG: Fix map_set_scale, the blue channel had to be reversed.  RES
  MAPLATLONG_GRID: Now allows grid spacing to be given for long and lat
    independently.  Even better, now allows a grid spacing in pixels to
    be given, defaults to 100 pixels.  Tries to space the grid for both
    long and lat to give about that spacing.  RES
9 Jan 2002
  MAPLATLONG: Tried to do a better job on the -180/+180 long break.
    Any time that break was included in the area the long was listed
    as ranging from -180 to +180 even when only a bit of long was 
    involved.  Now, as long as a pole is not in the area, the longs
    are offset to make them all <0 or all >0.  RES
  GIF2PNG: Minor addition to help text: saves as 8-bit PNG.  RES
  SCREENPNG: Should now allow 8-bit images (and 24-bit).  RES
  C2RGB: New routine to break a 24-bit color value into r,g,b.  RES
  MAPLATLONG_GRID: Added labels.  RES
  MAPWINDOW: Added new keyword THICKNESS=thk to specify outline
    thickness.  RES
7 Jan 2002
  TEXTPLOT: Added new keywords XBOX=bx, YBOX=by to return text bounding
    box x and y coordinates (in device coordinates).  This may be used to
    avoid crowded labels by computing the x and y size of the longest
    label (for example) and making sure any labels are spaced at least
    that far apart.  That is used in maplatlong_grid.pro.   RES
4 Jan 2002
  MAP_STATE_RESTORE: New routine to restore map scaling state.  RES
  MAP_STATE_SAVE: New routine to save map scaling state.  RES
  EXIF_READER: This should now work for IDL 5.0 and higher.  Had to work
    around not using uint and ulong.  RES
  MAPLATLONG: Now allows step size to be given.  Defaults to 3 pixels for
    each step in lat and long, covers window and converts to lat/long to
    search for max extent.  For maps over large areas or highly distorted
    maps, like /ortho, try step=1 for better results.  RES
  MAPWINDOW: New routine (to this library).  Returns screen window
    coordinates for last map plotted.  RES
3 Jan 2002
  EXIF_READER50: Finally got this working for Kodak cameras (D240
    anyway).  This should work in IDL 5.0.  RES
  MAPLATLONG_GRID: New routine to plot a lat/long grid.  Give grid
    spacing (same in both lat and long, color, linestyle, and
    thickness.  Uses last map_set command to determine what to plot.
    No labels are plotted.  RES
  MAPLATLONG: New routine (to this library).  Gives the complete lat/long
    range for the last map_set command.  By default expands range
    outward to next degree.  RES
2 Jan 2002
  EXIF_READER50: Just changed ulong to long so it should work in IDL5.0.  RES
30 Dec 2001
  MAP_SET_SCALE: Added new keyword NEWPOS=[ix1,iy1,ix2,iy2] to set a
    new map position, overriding the one in the scaling string.  This
    allows the map size to be changed.   Also now computes PIX, even
    if /ISO not set.  RES
  MAP_PUT_SCALE: Added new keyword PIX=pix to return map scale in
    pixels/degree.  For latitude only, assumes /ISOTROPIC was used.  RES
26 Dec 2001
  ZWINDOW: A few minor changes to try to get it to work better without
    any X windows reference.  Do set_plot,'z' before using.  RES
13 Dec 2001
  CONVERT_LIST: New routine that takes a compact text string description
    of a list of numbers and converts it to an actual numeric array.
    Works like convert_ind.pro.  Example:
	txt='.2:1:.2,3:8:2,1.234,2.345,3.456'
	print,convert_list(txt)
	0.20, 0.40, 0.60, 0.80, 1.00, 3.00, 5.00, 7.00, 1.234, 2.345, 3.456
    Give a list, but can also include start:end:step for uniform
    sequences.  Can mix both types.  Default step is 1. Can step in reverse:
	10:1 works.  RES
12 Dec 2001
  MANDELBROT: A few minor updates to make color tables work better.  RES
  MANDEL_GIF: New routine to convert images saved from mandelbrot to
    gif images.  RES
  ONE2THREE: Just corrected help text.  RES
10 Dec 2001
  CW_DROPLIST2: Like widget_droplist but with larger capacity.  RES
21 Nov 2001
  CHINIT: Just made background white.  Still have to handle background
    for any plotting when doing it.  Maybe should make chinit do
    device,decomp=0?  RES
16 Nov 2001
  EXIF_READER: Modified not to use Unsigned short ints, uint.  This allows
    this routine to work in older versions of IDL.  A simple trick is for
    in=uint([b1,b2],0) to substitute in=long([[b1,b2],0B,0B],0).  RES
5 Nov 2001
  PLOT_LIMBOX: New routine to plot map limits on a map.  Can give the
    same limits array as used in the map_set command.  By default plots
    great circles along limit box edges, use /rect for a rectangular box. RES
  MAPGC: Routine to plot a great circle connection between two points
    on a map.  RES
  LIMBOX: New routine to use an interactive box to return a map
    limits array.  Useful for rectangular map projections.  RES
31 Oct 2001
  FIRSTCHR: New routine to set the first character of a text string, adding
    it if needed.  Another function has a very similar name, firstchar, it
    finds the first non-white space character in the string.  RES
25 Oct 2001
  NAXES: Just added to the help text to use nx=5 (and /no25) to
    match IDL major ticks.  RES
24 Oct 2001
  WGS_84: Now documents which latitude is being used, geocentric or
    geodetic.  It allows either to be entered.  Returned structure
    now has both, also radius from rotation axis.  RES
23 Oct 2001
  IMGUNDER: Noticed that image was shifting when the /INTERPOLATE option
    was used.  Added a correction for that.  RES
15 Oct 2001
  JS2YMDS: Upgraded.  Converts Julian Seconds to Year, Month, Day
    and either seconds into day or hours, minutes, seconds, depending
    on the number of arguments.  RES
  LASTCHR: New function to make sure the last character of a text
    string is the given value.  If the string already ends with the
    specified character it is returned, else the character is added.  RES
9 Oct 2001
  TETRIS: Just made the default speed a bit slower.  RES
5 Oct 2001
  MONTH2NAME: New function to convert from a month number to a
    month name.  Works for single values or arrays of values.  RES
2 Oct 2001
  THREE2ONE: New routine to convert from 3-d indices to 1-d index.  RES

25 Sep 2001
  WHICHWRD: New function that returns the word number into a string
    of a given substring.  May then extract that word using getwrd.  RES
24 Sep 2001
  IMG_ILLUMINATE: Added /desat keyword to deal with overflow in a color
    channel (R,G, or B) by distributing the extra to the other two channels.
    This makes bright illuminations desaturate, more like a photograph.  RES
20 Sep 2001
  IMG_ILLUMINATE: New routine to simulate illuminating an image
    with colored light.  Like projecting a transparency onto a
    base image.  Additive process.  RES
  IMG_CFILTER: New routine to simulate viewing an image through a
    color transparency.  Subtractive process.  RES
  IMG_STRETCH: Was not working for some cases, fixed.  RES
19 Sep 2001
  GIFADD: Modified to check if using X windows before displaying.  RES
  ZWINDOW: Added help text to mention to close a zwindow before
    resizing it or size won't change.  Only 1 zwindow at a time.  RES
  INVINTERP: New routine by BLG to do inverse interpolation.  RES
14 Sep 2001
  ZWINDOW: Added some help text on text and symbol sizes being
    different in the Z-buffer.  RES
10 Sep 2001
  LINE_FIT: New routine to fit a line to x,y points.  Minimizes mean square
    distances from the line.  May give weights for each point.  RES

  ELL_XYZ2LLH: From x,y,z compute ellipsoidal longitude,
    latitude, and height.  RES
  ELL_LLH2XYZ: From ellpisoidal longitude, latitude, and height
    compute x,y,z.  RES

    together alphabetically.  RES
  ELL_LL2RB: Renamed LL2RBE so all related routines will list
    together alphabetically.  RES
  RB2LLE: Fixed a minor bug that was throwing distances off by 6 or 7
    hundred meters in 1000 km.  Now good to better than .5 mm and more often
    good to tens or hundreds of microns.  Not checkd over wide ranges yet.
    Should make a random point checker.  RES
6 Sep 2001
  RB2LLE: Modified to allow arrays as inputs.  RES
5 Sep 2001
  RB2LLE: Compute long,lat of a point given range and bearing from
    a point on a WGS84 ellipsoid.  Ported from a fortran program.  RES

13 Aug 2001
  IMG_RESIZE: Just added help text for the IMGMAX keyword.  RES
31 Jul 2001
  SECHMS: Added some missing quote marks that was causing trouble for
    Randall Skelton in IDL 2.3.  Newer versions of IDL are ok.  RES
26 Jul 2001
  XVIEW: Fixed the problem with the img_resize call.  Also dropped
    size_img (obsolete) for img_shape.  RES
23 Jul 2001
  SECSTR: Now allows time strings without colons, like 174636 (17:46:36).  RES
20 Jul 2001
  STRINGFORM: New function to get around the 1024 line limit of explicitly
    formatted strings in IDL.  RES
19 Jul 2001
  XVIEW: Can now save JPEG files correctly for 24-bit color.
    Just uses jpegscreen to do the save.  The other formats are
    not yet handled correctly.  RES
12 Jul 2001
  EXIF_READER: Now returns the image orientation flag, 1-8.  RES
3 Jul 2001
  IMG_RESIZE: Added new keyword IMGMAX to allow max image size to be set.  RES
  IMG_INSIMG: New routine to insert a subimage into an image.  This is for
    24-bit color images only.  Base image and subimage need not have the same
    shape.  This routine has a lot of options and features.  The area to use
    from the subimage may be given in the call.  Also it is not limited to
    a straight replacement, color channels may be replaced individually, RGB
    or HSV.  For example, to color part of the base image based on colors in
    a subimage, the subimage H and S channels may be used to replace the
    base image's H and S in the given area.  The substituted channels may
    be weighted.  Also the value (brightness) may be replaced or mixed with
    the subimage value.  If H is used it may be given an offset to change
    the hue which is substituted.  RES
28 Jun 2001
  TEXTPLOT: Minor cleanup.  RES
22 Jun 2001
  IMG_MERGE: New routine to merge RGB or HSV components to form

  EQV3: Now may optional include units for each adjustable
    parameter.  Just add somethine like units=ft/sec to the end
    of a prameter line in the eqv file (or text array).  RES
  EQV3_LOAD_HELP: documented the newly added units feature.  RES
19 Jun 2001

  PRWINDOW: Upgraded for 24-bit color.  RES
  PSIMG: Upgraded for 24-bit color.  RES
30 May 2001
  TPRINT: Added a new keyword: SAVE=file to save the internal
    tprint text array in a text file.  Can use with the /REVERSE
    keyword (also /PRINT).  RES
25 May 2001
  TPRINT: Now may be initialized to a given text array:
    tprint,init=txtarray.  Also tprint,/init clears as before.
    Added new keyword: ADD=txt to add text to end of internal
    text array.  With these new additions a text array can be
    built up a line at a time or a block of text.  RES
24 May 2001
  MONTHNAMES: Upgraded to return month name given month number or
    array of numbers.  Also added keywords to control case and
    full or 3 letter names.  RES
23 May 2001
  TXTGETKEY: Added the new keyword /STRUCTURE to return all the
    keywords and values together in a structure.  Convenient.  RES
  ARROW2: Cleaned up some extra plot statements.  Also convert final
    coordinates to /device before plotting arrow since IDL truncates
    coordinates.  Rounds to nearest pixel now so shape is not offset.
    Unfortunately my old routine, named arrow.pro, was in the library
    up till now.  I had renamed this routine to arrow2 in 1993 to avoid
    the newer IDL arrow routine (which didn't exist when I wrote mine).
    Sorry for any broken software this might cause (in a pinch rename
    a copy of arrow2.pro and edit the internal name to arrow and
    put it on the path).  RES
11 May 2001
  TEXTPLOT: Now defaults to data coordinates if none specified.  RES
10 May 2001
  TERMINATOR__DEFINE: Sun terminator object.  Plots sun rise/set curve

  UTNOW: New routine to return current Universal Time in Julian Seconds.
    A simple shortcut.  RES
19 Apr 2001
  PATH: Kristian Kjaer added the new keyword PATHARRAY to return the
    directories on the path as a text array.  RES
4 Apr 2001
  PUT_SCALE: Added new keywords: /NOEMBED means do not embed scaling
    info in image, and TEXT=txt return scaling info string.  RES
30 Mar 2001
  SCREENPNG: Should now do a regular set_scale (8 or 24 bit images).
    Sometimes creates window partly off screen and tvrd cannot deal
    with that, so had to extract any scaling info from image, instead
    of reading back from screen.  RES
  SET_SCALE: Modified to handle 8 or 24 bit images.  RES
  PUT_SCALE: Modified to handle 8 or 24 bit images.  RES
  ZPAN: Now uses winlist to know which windows to use.  RES
  WINLIST: New routine to list windows in use.  Gives window indices,
    sizes, and positions.  Also indicates which is the current window.
    Also returns a list of windows in use and windows not in use.  RES

28 Mar 2001
  ZWINDOW:  Added new keyword /FREE to force a new display window
    on /COPY.
  VERI: Somehow the working copy of veri was not working, but the
    source copy was.  This is just to update it.  RES
  POINT: Added new keywords SIDES=n, ANGLE=ang to allow some extra
    symbol shapes.  RES
27 Mar 2001
  IMG_RGB: New routine to split an image into R,G,B components.  RES
26 Mar 2001
  IMG_SHAPE: New routine to return the shape of an image.  Works for
    2-D or 3-D images and gives image dimensions and which dimension
    of a 3-D images is interleaved.  RES
22 Mar 2001
  FINDPLACE: New routine to return city lat/long given name.  Has
    two modes, World, and US.  US uses a large database (18 MB)
    so will be slower, but has over 164000 populated places.  RES
  MAP_SET_SCALE: Was only computing PIX if /list used, now always
    computes pix.  RES
  RESGET: Fixed a bug added on Mar 18.  Was reading CHR data as string
    not byte so was wrong.  RES
21 Mar 2001
  PNGSCREEN: New routine to save a screen image in a PNG file.  RES
  SCREENPNG: New routine to display a PNG image in a screen window.
    Also attempts to set the map scaling from embedded scaling info
    which is assumed to be embedded in the blue channel.  RES
  MAP_SET_SCALE: Upgraded to handle invalid text string input.  RES
  IMG_SHIFT: New routine to shift a 2-d or 3-d image in x and y.  RES
  TPRINT: New routine (to this library) designed to easily convert
    print statements to store printed items to an internal text array
    instead of displaying them immediately.  Can later print all the lines
    or return them as a text array.  Also added /REVERSE flag.  RES
18 Mar 2001
  RESGET: Fixed to read the new IDL data types.  resput could write them,
    but resget couldn't read them.  Does not deal with structures, objects,
    or pointers, just numeric and string scalars and arrays.  RES
8 Mar 2001
  POINTID: New routine to allow interactive ID of plotted points.  This
    work for both scatter plots and points plotted on a map.  Assumes
    the data coordinate system is still current.  RES
6 Mar 2001
  MAP_SET_SCALE: Added new keyword TEXT=txt to pass in map scaling
    string.  This is instead of reading from the screen or image
    and allows cases where the scaling is not embedded in the image.
    For example, perhaps the scaling info is obtained from a JPEG header. RES
5 Mar 2001
  POLYSTAT: Added /CURVE mode to give arc length instead of perimeter.  RES
1 Mar 2001
  PATH: Corrected back on 20 Sep, 2000 but somehow not copied to library.  RES
15 Feb 2001
  COLOR_WHEEL: Now lists HSV and RGB values.  RES
29 Jan 2001
  ZWINDOW: Added an option to return image and color table.  RES

    in 8 or 24 bit images.  RES
  IMG_RESIZE: Allowed separate x and y mag factors.  RES
26 Jan 2001
  GETFILE: Fixed a bug that dropped the first line when the LINES=
    keyword was used.  RES
24 Jan 2001

15 Jan 2001
  GETWRD: Fixed to not blow up for string arrays.  Expects a scalar but
    will use the first element if given an array.  RES
12 Jan 2001
  XCURSOR: Minor upgrade to get map right.  RES
  CROSSI: Updated for latest !map structure.  RES
8 Jan 2001
  IMG_HSV: New routine to adjust image Hue, Saturation, and Value.
    Give hue offset, and sat and val factors.  RES
  IMG_STRETCH: New routine to stretch an image.  Works for 2-D or 3-D images.
    Does grayscale stretching according to given values.  RES
  IMG_SMOOTH: New routine to smooth an image.  Works for 2-D or 3-D images,
    and uses convolution smoothing.  Can smooth less than the IDL smooth
    routine using a 3x3 window.  RES
  XVIEW: Edited to use following renamed routines.  RES
  IMG_RESIZE: Renamed from resize_img.pro.  RES
  IMG_ROTATE: Renamed from rotate_img.pro.  RES
5 Jan 2001
  YY2YYYY: Added a special check for string values.  If the incoming
    2 digit year is a string then the returned result will be converted
    to string (with no spaces on the ends).  RES
2 Jan 2001
  EXIF_READER: Minor error handling upgrade.  RES
  SCREENJPEG: Fixed a minor bug in the non-standard extension listing.  RES
28 Dec 2000
  CONVEXHULL: Dropped.  I thought this used to work but it doesn't
    now. Use triangulate instead.  It optionally returns the indices
    of points on the convex hull.  RES
26 Dec 2000
  SPH_RANGE_MAP: Added a bit more help text.  RES
  CRS_EDIT: Fixed to work on new computer.  Might break elsewhere. 
    Old code just commented out so could fix.   RES
  SPL_ANGINT: Fixed help text error.  RES
  SCREENGIF: Modified to optionally return the image array.  This allows
    it to be used for other purposes, such as extracting scaling info
    using set_scale (if available).  RES
  EXIF_READER: New routine to read values from Exif files.  Exif files
    are the JPEG files recent digital cameras.  This routine can list 
    values such is when the image was shot (to the fraction of a second
    in some cases, f-number, shutter speed, focal length used, and lots
    of other values.  It can also return these values in a structure.
    Can optionally list all tags found in the Exif file.  RES
20 Dec 2000
  HEXDUMP: Modified to allow byte arrays to be dumped.  RES
18 Dec 2000
  ZWINDOW: Fixed a to make a new window for /copy if the old was deleted.  RES
22 Nov 2000
  HEXDUMP: New routine to do a hex dump of a file.  RES
20 Nov 2000
  COLOR_WHEEL: New routine, interactive color picker using a
    color wheel.  Returns a 24 bit color value.   RES
14 Nov 2000
  XYOUTB: Added new keyword SHIFT=shft.  This allows easy drop shadows
    using values like shift=[-2,2] for color=[black,white].  RES
9 Nov 2000
  MAP_SET_SCALE: Minor fix to use given image instead of reading it.  RES
30 Oct 2000
  PHASE: Fixed a minor indexing problem.  RES
25 Oct 2000
  GIF2PNG: New routine to convert GIF images to PNG.  Both GIF and PNG
    are lossless formats.  Current IDL write_png appears to write the
    images flipped in Y.  Other applications then bring them in
    flipped (like web browsers).  So for now this routine flips the
    image before writing.  This may be fixed in the next version of
    IDL, but GIF won't be supported so it won't matter anyway.  RES
3 Oct 2000
  XVIEW: Fixed to work for 8 bits (again).  RES
26 Sep 2000
  XVIEW: Upgraded to deal with 24-bit display.  Now loads images.
    Next fix to save images.  RES
  SIZE_IMG: New routine to return image interleave index (if true color)
    and dimensions for any 2-D or 3-D color image.  RES
21 Sep 2000
  RESIZE_IMG: New routine to apply congrid to color images.  RES
  ROTATE_IMG: New routine to apply the rotate function to color images.
    Rotate only works for 1-d and 2-d arrays.  This routine checks the
    dimensions and if 3-d finds which dimension is the color channels.  RES
20 Sep 2000
  TARCLR: Modified to check for decomp=0 and treat as 8-bit color.  This
    makes it work with color tables even on 24-bit displays.  RES
19 Sep 2000
  DAYGLOBE: Modified to list ref point and sun pos at ref pt.  RES
  SUN_COLORS: Added 10 degree banded day color tables (use /quantized).  RES
12 Sep 2000
  MOVTXT: Added color to text display commands.  RES
11 Sep 2000
  GIFSCREEN: Updated for 24 bit color.  RES
30 Aug 2000
  XTXTIN: Now allows null strings for ptags and pvals but ignores and
    does not give preset button menu.  RES
28 Aug 2000
  CREATED: Added new keyword VERB=txt to allow wording to be changed.  RES
23 Aug 2000
  SCREENGIF: Fixed to only do any device,decomp commands for X device.  RES
22 Aug 2000
  XTXTIN: Added preset text option.  Can load up this widget with
    lots of text that can be selected using a drop down menu button.
    Uses short tags to specify text.  RES
21 Aug 2000
  EQV3: Added XOFFSET, YOFFSET to position widget.  RES
18 Aug 2000
  XCURSOR: Added new keyword TEXT to set text to display (def=Press
    any button to exit).  May be a text array.  Also fixed a problem
    with the input coordionates: the !x.typ changed from 2 to 3 for
    maps.  Also !map changed to default x,y for maps changed. RES
17 Aug 2000
  XTXTIN: Added new keyword XSIZE to allow width to be set.  RES
  XCURSOR: Added XOFFSET and YOFFSET keywords to allow status display
    to be positioned.  RES
  DT_TM_TOJS: Added /QUIET keyword to make handling errors cleaner.  RES
14 Aug 2000
  RESCOM: Fixed a bug for the case where r_swap was undefined.  This
    came up on resopen,/write.  Now just ignores r_swap if not defined.  RES
8 Aug 2000
  XCURVE: Fixed a problem with repeated points.  Still does not erase
    old points very well.  RES
4 Aug 2000
  XYOUTB: Foxed a bug that came up for bold=0.  RES
1 Aug 2000
  DATA_BLOCK: The calling line # changed for some reason making this
    routine break.  Fixed to work, but might break on another system.  RES
28 Jul 2000
  LMST: Fixed an error in a comment, had wrong date for initial time.  RES
29 Jun 2000
  SUBIMG: Modified to deal with 24 bit color displays.  RES
  SCREENJPEG: Modified to deal with 24 bit color displays.  RES
  JPEGSCREEN: Modified to deal with 24 bit color displays.  RES
  SCREENGIF: Modified to do device,decomp=0 and also map_set_scale.  RES
  MAP_SET_SCALE: Added IMAGE=img keyword so scale can be set from
    a given image instead of reading from screen image.  RES
  SET_SCALE: fixed a minor typo.  RES
29 Jun 2000
  XVIEW: Fixed a typo in the code (don't know how it got there, hasn't
    been touched for quite a while).  RES
23 Jun 2000
  JSPLOT: Added new keyword: LSHIFT=sec (see below).  RES
  TIMEAXIS: Added new keyword: LSHIFT=sec to allow axis label to be
    shifted by given number of seconds.  Main intent was to offset
    month labels by 15 days: LSHIFT=15*86400D0 to center on month.  RES
  DT_TM_MAK: Added weekday number to format.  Sun=1, Mon=2, ... Sat=7.  RES
  JS_INCMONTH: Increment a time in Julian Seconds by a month (or
    a given number of months).  So 2000 May 23 12:46:52 would give
    2000 Jun 23 12:46:52.  When used with dt_tm_fromjs this is useful
    for generating a series of monthly file names.  RES
2 Jun 2000
  SCREENGIF: Fixed to correctly handle embedded scaling info for
    24 bit color displays.  RES
1 Jun 2000
  POINT: Added /CLIP option to clip am array of points to the
     clipping window.  RES
31 May 2000
  CPOSPRINT: New routine to print a text string showing character
     positions listed above the text.  RES
23 May 2000
  EQV3: Added =yes or =no to flags to make it easy to see state.  RES
22 May 2000
  HORI: Found this routine broken for 24-bit color.  Fixed.  RES
  SCREENGIF: Fixed to work with Z buffer.  Also now does set_scale.  RES
  ZWINDOW: Fixed to resize display window on /copy if wrong size.  RES
21 May 2000
  EQV3: Added flags, wait option, and return of paramater values.  RES
  EQV3_LOAD_HELP: Loads help text into common for quicker response.  RES
12 May 2000
  EQV3: New routine to execute IDL code or routines with interactively
    varied parameters.  Parameters are varied using slider bars.  More
    general than eqv2 since any IDL code may be used and not just a
    plot.  Perhaps useful to build other routines.  RES
7 May 2000
  ZWINDOW: Fixed a minor bug that clobbered the entry device at times.  RES
20 Apr 2000
  IMGUNDER: Modified to accept /NODATA.  RES
  IZOOM: The /NODATA keyword caused a big problem, so changed to /AXES_ONLY
    instead.  RES
18 Apr 2000
  IZOOM: Added new keyword /NODATA.  Just plots axes.  This is useful
    for mixing 8 and 24 bit graphics.  The first izoom call can display
    an image using a color table by first calling device,decomp=0.
    The do device,decomp=1 and izoom with /nodata.  Second izoom call
    uses 24 bit color for axes so can set to anything (default white). RES
17 Apr 2000
  ZWINDOW: Removed the close on the /COPY command.  Didn't need that.
    Now the z window remembers the image even if the plot device is
    switched to display the /copy.  Changing the color table changes the
    displayed image even for 24-bit color since the z buffer is 8 bit.  RES
11 Apr 2000
  RESOPEN: Fixed to deal with endian.  Detects if endian is same as
    current computer and sets swap flag if not.  This allows res files
    created on opposite endian systems to be readable transparently.  RES
  RESGET: Fixed to deal with endian.  RES
  RESCOM: Fixed to deal with endian.  RES
  RESPUT: Added to internal common, no effect here.  RES
  RESCLOSE: Added to internal common, no effect here.  RES
  ENDIAN: Minor change to work better with rescom.  RES
10 Apr 2000
  TETRIS: Fixed to work for 24 bit color.  Just does a device,decomp=0.
    Should restore original state but doesn't.  RES
28 Mar 2000
  MAP_TEST_SCALE: Just added device,/decomp=0 to allow color.  RES
28 Mar 2000
  ZWINDOW: New routine to use the z buffer for 8 bit images.  Can do 8 bit
    images on a 24 bit display more easily.  Has a copy option to show
    result on screen.  RES
8 Mar 2000
  RESOPEN: Fixed check that tests if file is a res file.  Was assuming header
    size less than some limit, but big files may have bigger headers.  Now
    computes expected file size from first 3 long words.  RES
7 Jan 2000
  DT_TM_MAK: Just clarified the help text to state that I$ and i$ only
    work for sec in dt_tm_mak.  They do not do anything useful if 
    used for dt_tm_fromjs.  RES
6 Jan 2000
  NUMFACTORS: Added new keywords: /QUIET to suppress listing factors,
    and PROGRESS=n to show progress every n values.  RES
  FACTOR: Fixed to ignore 0 or negative values.  RES
3 Jan 2000
  DT_TM_MAK: A problem became apparent when year changed to 2000.  Not
    a Y2K problem but one when year ended in 0, so a decade problem.
    The previous version modified a copy of the format string, but the
    changes modified the format on the fly.  New version bases changes
    on original format string.  Also now uses builtin IDL routines so
    might be a bit faster.  RES
14 Dec 1999
  OBJ_DRAW: Improved the debug mode option.  Can turn the error handler
    on if debug is not on, else do not and real error shows up.  RES
13 Dec 1999
  ENDIAN: New function to determine which endian the current machine uses.
    If data was generated on a machine with a different endian and is
    accessed as other than bytes then the bytes must be swapped using
    byteorder with the proper keyword.  RES
7 Dec 1999
  CROSSI: Fixed to work correctly for /PIXEL for 24 bit color.  Also fixed
    a bug with /MAG.  RES
3 Dec 1999
  PLOTP: Added new keyword THICK.  RES
1 Dec 1999
  SPH_RANGE_MAP: New function to compute the range from a point on a
    sphere for a regular grid of locations on the sphere.  Useful for
    many purposes: sun altitudes, moon phase, range maps, ... RES
30 Nov 1999
  CRS_EDIT: New routine to create or edit a cursor bitmap image and
    mask.  Use to make new cursor shapes.  RES
  ISNUMBER: Fixed a bug found by Kristian Kjaer, Physics Department,
    Risoe National Laboratory, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.
    Was failing for numbers like -5E-2, two - signs.  Also two + signs.
    This routine could be shortened quite a bit if it were rewritten.  RES
  ARRAY_LIST: New routine to list a given array in a form easy to
    cut and paste into new IDL code.  For numeric arrays only, no
    check for strings.  RES
24 Nov 1999
  TARCLR: Added new keyword /B24 to force into 24 bit mode even if
    on an 8 bit system.  Perhaps useful for testing.  RES
16 Nov 1999
  OBJ_DRAW: Added group_leader passing to the object's XSET method.
    The object should use it on the top level control panel base so
    the panel is destroyed when the resizeable window is destroyed.  RES
15 Nov 1999
  OBJ_DRAW: Added a debug option.  Will stop and allow the object method
    that failed to be called manually so error can be seen.  RES
11 Nov 1999
  TARCLR: Upgraded to allow colors to be reserved.  This required a number
    of new keywords: INIT=[lo,hi] Set up a block of working colors,
    /ADD add a new reserved color from the available list, DROP=i drop
    a reserved color from use, /LIST list available colors.  In addition
    SET=i was modified to reserve that selected color if it is in the
    working color range.  Reserved colors allow multiple routines to 
    better shared the same color table space if each needs only a few
    colors.  Add those routines may return the colors when done.  RES
8 Nov 1999
  IMGARRAY: New routine to take a list of GIF images all the same size
    and make an array of reduced versions and save as a GIF.  RES
3 Nov 1999
  LGRADIENT: Simple linear gradient image.  Intended for detrending.  Easy
    specification of parameters.  If a gradient array is generated in G,
    and the image to detrend is in A then New = A*(1+G).  The gradient image
    is 0 at the center, and reaches 1 at a specified distance.  Vary that
    distance to vary the gradient strength.  Gradient angle is given.  RES
  WIN_COPY: Just copied to lib.  Seemed not to have the latest version.  RES
20 Oct 1999
  WHOAMI: Needed line number in the source file.  Went to add it and
    found it was there in the local copy.  Just sending it to the
    main libraries.  RES
19 Oct 1999
  CROSSI: Upgraded for 24 bit color.  RES
  TVRD2: Upgraded for 24 bit color.  RES
  ZPAN: Upgraded for 24 bit color.  RES
18 Oct 1999
  DAYGLOBE: Allowed time to be given as a string or JS.  RES
15 Oct 1999
  SUNALTAZI: Made date/time entry a bit less picky.  RES
  IGLOBE: Allowed horizon to be turned off.  This allows some nice geo-art,
    make the water the same color as the background, and the coast the
    same color as the land, and turn off the horizon.  RES
  DAYGLOBE: Plot a globe and show areas of daylight, twilight, and night.  RES
14 Oct 1999
  WORLD_SUNZD: New routine to compute sun zenith distances for
    points around the world.  Uses the fast algorithm, about 10
    times faster than the old way.  RES
  SUN_COLORS: Added a keyword, /DEEPER, to load the original,
    deeper colors.  RES
12 Oct 1999
  IGLOBE: Keep given arguments within valid bounds.  RES
  TARCLR: Better handling of bad arguments.  RES
11 Oct 1999
  IGLOBE: Made a lot of changes to the on the nearweb site and it
    got overwritten so had to reconstruct.  RES
10 Oct 1999
  IGLOBE: Corrected the GRID flag to accept 0 correctly.  RES
6 Oct 1999
  IGLOBE: New routine to plot a globe.  Made to learn ION Script.  RES
5 Oct 1999
  MAP_PUT_SCALE: Added /EMBED, /NOEMBED, SC_STR=sc_str keywords.  RES
4 Oct 1999
  POSBOX: Modified some time ago to look outside the position box instead
    of inside.  Just updating library.  RES
  MAP_SET_SCALE: Used to set up the map coordinate system as determined
    from the scaling info embedded in the image by map_put_scale.  RES
  MAP_PUT_SCALE: Newly revised (replaces previous version).  Determines
    all the information needed to redefine the map coordinate system and
    embeds it in the first image line.  If the image is then saved in a
    non-lossy format the map coordinates can be set up again after the
    image is loaded to the screen.  Use map_set_scale to do that.
    Note, this routine has a lot of special cases and work arounds since
    not all the needed info is readily available.  Future changes in the
    operation of map_set may break this technique (as happened in the past).
    But it is very useful so may be worth the risk.  RES
28 Sep 1999
  XVIEW: Switched to read_tiff from tiff_read.  Now can read compressed
    TIFF.  But the returned ORDER value seems off, should be 0 or 1 but is
    16436 or 16437.  RES
27 Sep 1999
  JSPLOT: Fixed a bug added when jsplot was modified.  RES
23 Sep 1999
  JSPLOT: New keywords JSMAJOR=jsmaj, JSMINOR=jsmin to return major and minor
    tick mark positions in JS.  Very useful for custom time grids.  RES
  TIMEAXIS: New keywords TMAJOR=tmaj, TMINOR=tmin to return major and minor
    tick mark positions.  RES
15 Sep 1999
  LS: Added new keyword: /NOSCALE to skip actual scaling of the data.
    Used to find the values derived by the histogram technique.
    Should save a little time, not a lot.  RES
  TVSHARP: Added new keywords: SMOOTH=sm, WEIGHT=wt.  Default to original
    values.  RES
13 Sep 1999
  OBJ_DRAW: New routine to do display the results of an object's
    draw method in a resizable window.  RES
9 Sep 1999
  SUNCLOCK: Added optional track plot.  Still need to speed up.  RES
  POSBOX: New routine to check if there is an outline drawn around
    the plot position in the window.  The test is that the possible
    outline all be the same color and not equal to any pixels just
    inside it.  This is a problem if anything on the inside touches
    the possible outline, it will be considered to exist even if it
    doesn't.  The main purpose was to tell if map_set used the
    /noborder keyword.  Should work ok for that.  RES
17 Aug 1999
  COLORIZE: New routine to colorize an image.  Will modify an image based
    on a colorize image.  The colorize image gives the hue and sat, the val
    comes from the original image.  RES
16 Aug 1999
  WIN_REDIRECT: Added disable/enable options as new keywords:
    /ON, /OFF.  This globally changes the operation of redirection
    with one easy call.  RES
12 Aug 1999
  WIN_REDIRECT: New routine.  Makes it easy to modify software to use a
    hidden window to build up a graphics image and then copy it quickly
    to the display window (using WIN_COPY).  RES
  WIN_COPY: Copies the hidden window set up by WIN_REDIRECT to the
    display window.  Can use these two routines to make smoother
    graphics.  RES
10 Aug 1999
  IMGSCALE: Fixed the problem of scrolling windows being locked when running
    imgscale.  Now the middle mouse button displays a move message and
    waits while image is scrolled.  Then the mouse cursor jumps back
    where it was.  RES
9 Aug 1999
  SET_SCALE: Added new keywords IMAGE=img, and /NOSET.  This allows
    image to be passed in so scaling info may be extracted, but the
    scale set can be suppressed to avoid changing the exising scaling.  RES
4 Aug 1999
  DT_TM_TOJS: Improved the 2 digit year fix by using yy2yyyy.  RES
  DATE2JD: Improved the 2 digit year fix by using yy2yyyy.  RES
  YMD2DATE: Improved the 2 digit year fix by using yy2yyyy.  RES
  YY2YYYY: Fixed so it doesn't change 4 digit years.  Also now
    handles arrays and allows a base year to be given to override
    the current year.  RES
2 Aug 1999
  NGROUPS: Return number of groups of identical elements in an array.
    Works like NRUNS.  RES
  GETGROUP: Get N'th group of identical elements from an array.
    Works like GETRUN.  RES
  MONTHNUM: New function to return month number given it's name.
    Jan=1, Feb=2, ...   RES
  YY2YYYY: New function to convert a 2 digit year to a 4 digit year.
    Two digit years will always be useful, this function should work
    without breaking as long as the target year is not more than one
    century away.  It is especially useful around a century rollover
    and for a few years after.  It will convert a 2 digit year to the
    closest 4 digit year.  The keyword /PAST forces the target year to
    be in the past (useful for birthdates).  RES
30 Jul 1999
  TARCLR: Fixed so even for 24 bit color, if the color table is given
    by the keywords RED, GREEN, and BLUE the closest match will be
    found for the given color table.  RES
29 Jul 1999
  TARCLR: Added new keywords: RED=red, GREEN=green, BLUE=blue, and
    /NOLOAD to allow a given color table to be updated using TARCLR
    and optionally avoid screen color table update.  If SET=i is given
    with RED, GREEN, and BLUE then the given color table is updated.
    If SET=i is not given then the given color table is used to find
    the closest target color instead of the color table loaded in the
    device.  RES
28 Jul 1999
  TARCLR: Added new keyword /HSV to allow Hue, Sat, and Val for color
    input.  With the SET=i keyword this routine makes it easy to construct
    custom color tables.  RES
9 Jul 1999
  FACTOR: Fixed bugs introduced by the last upgrade to bigger integers.
    Old IDL can't deal with 1ULL for example (and doesn't even have 1UL
    like I was using).  Routines can't even compile with such a statement,
    but it would be nice to have the same routine work for both IDL 5.2 and
    before.  A useful trick is to hide the new data type in an execute
    statement that only gets called in IDL 5.2 or later.  RES
  PRINT_FACT: Same.  RES
8 Jul 1999
  PUT_SCALE: Added scaling info logging to a text file.  If the new
    keyword LOG=name is given a value then the scaling info is logged
    to the text file put_scale.txt in the HOME directory.  The info
    is appended to an existing put_scale.txt which is created if not there. RES
7 Jul 1999
  FACTOR: Went to unsigned integers, can now work up to the limit of
    ulong64 numbers.  RES
  PRINT_FACT: Same.  RES
2 Jul 1999
  PRINT_FACT: Better formatting.  RES
  SPC: Added /NOTRIM keyword to preserve spaces in given text string.  RES
  BOX2B: Fixed a minor typo in the box listing.  RES
30 Jun 1999
  PRINT_FACT: Modified to handle bigger values, also better printout.  RES
  FACTOR: Improved.  Faster, bigger.  RES
  INT_LOW: New function to drop a value or array to the lowest integer
    precision needed to hold a given value.  The reference value may
    be given separately from the value to convert.  Useful to reduce
    to bytes needed to store values.  RES
  ZERO_INT: New function to return a zero of the same datatype as the
    given argument.  Useful to promote another value of lower precision
    to the higher precision data type: a = a + zero_int(b).  RES
15 Jun 1999
  WIN_OPEN: New function to tell if a window is open for use.  RES
9 Jun 1999
  SCRAMBLE: Upgraded to long ints to allow bigger arrays.  RES
8 Jun 1999
  PUTBITS: New routine to insert specified bits into a target.
    Works for scalars or arrays.  RES
  GETBITS:  Cleaned up some.  Also works for arrays.  RES
  SHOWBITS: Cleaned up some.  Also works for arrays.  RES
7 Jun 1999
  SHOWBITS: New routine to display the bit pattern for integer
    scalar values.  Can display bits in binary, octal, or hex.  RES
4 Jun 1999
  GETBITS: New routine to pick out specified bits from an integer
    data type (byte, int, u_int, long, u_long, long_64, u_long_64).
    Returns bits in same data type but shifted to start at LSB.  RES
  DATATYPE: Added new IDL datatypes.  Also added returned codes useful
    for indicating if a variable is integer, float, complex, or none,
    and how many bits in integer data types.  RES
3 Jun 1999
  BASECON: Added new keyword GROUP=g to group digits together.  This is
    very useful for breaking long strings into bytes or words.
    For example:
	print,basecon(12345,to=2,dig=24,group=8)

  SPHPLOT: Fixed a problem with visible hemisphere clipping, was clipping
    away points just slightly in back hemisphere even when far from surface.
    Visible hemisphere was considered any point within 90.01 degrees of
    line of sight.  Now made invisible hemisphere be more than 89.99 so
    /HIDDEN will plot those points.  Also added new keyword, /ALL that
    just ignores hemisphere clipping plane for curves and points.  RES
3 May 1999
  POLREC: Converted to double precision computation.  Angle conversion
    must be careful not to use !radeg for double.  Do radeg=180/!dpi
    instead.  This flows through to polrec3d also.  RES
3 May 1999
  SPHPLOT: Fixed bug in returned plotted points array for the no
    points case. RES
30 Apr 1999
  XVIEW: Worked around a bug in IDL 5.2 that does not allow wdelete if
    no windows exist.  RES
23 Apr 1999
  GETFILE: Fixed a long time bug that made it fail on 1 line files.  RES
14 Apr 1999
  GETFILE: Added new keyword LINES=n to indicate number of lines to
    read from a text file.  This allows large text files to be read
    much faster using getfile.  RES
19 Mar 1999
  LOGLUT: Added some new keywords to generalize.  Can now map between
    specified gray levels and also reverse lookup table.  Default 
    output table is float but can round.  RES
15 Mar 1999
  BOX2B: Added new keyword /YREVERSE to reverse Y coordinate to put
    y=0 at top of window.  Sometimes useful for working with image
    coordinates used by other software packages.  RES
22 Feb 1999
  SCREENGIF: Loaded color table before image, so should work for
    24 bit displays.  RES
25 Nov 1998
  DATE2DOY: New routine to convert from date to day of year.  RES
10 Nov 1998
  LOGLUT: Added keyword /TOP to scale to top available color index. 
    Defaults to 255.  RES
6 Nov 1998
  LOGLUT: New routine to return a log lookup table useful to scale
    images.  Especially useful for 16 bit data.  Can specified various
    lookup table curvatures.  RES
5 Nov 1998
  VUMOV: Now allows a color table in movie file as RED, GREEN, BLUE
    entries.  RES
4 Nov 1998
  VUMOV: Remove the need to give frame XSIZE and YSIZE in res movie
    file.  vumov just detects the correct size from the file itself.
    Also detects frame data type but warns if not type byte.  RES
2 Nov 1998
  WGS_84: New function to return a few useful values for the WGS 84
    ellipsoid (approximation to shape of the earth).  RES
27 Oct 1998
  EQV2: Fixed color bug.  When color was added it messed up cases
    that didn't have color.  Should be fixed.  RES
19 Oct 1998
  IZOOM_SUB: New routine to zoom up part of an image.  Must have embedded
    scaling added by put_scale.  RES
  SET_SCALE: Added an error flag to indicate if no scaling info found.  RES
1 Oct 1998
  VUMOV: New routine to view a movie res file.  Do vumov,/help
    for details.  Useful for long movies too big for memory.  RES
30 Sep 1998
  GRAB_COMMANDS: Added time tag so won't IDL sessions won't overwrite
    each other.  RES
28 Sep 1998
  RESPUT: Dropped code forcing longword alignment of each new write.
    Don't know why that was there, it messed up movie files.  RES
24 Sep 1998
  GRAB_COMMANDS: New routine to grab command line recall buffer and save
    it in a text file.  RES
25 Aug 1998
  JSPLOT: Fixed a problem related to the MAX_VALUE keyword (same as the
    keyword used by PLOT, so not mentioned in the jsplot help).  Was
    setting the default value of this to max(y), but that makes 2 point
    plots not plot the line.  Changed to set the default to max(y)+1.  RES
10 Aug 1998
  DT_TM_MAK: Ran into a problem with the way IDL handles subscripting
    structure arrays.  If you try to insert a value into a single element
    structure array that value must be a scalar, single element arrays are
    not allowed as for normal arrays.  Had to add indexing that is only
    needed for single element arrays.  RES
5 Aug 1998
  XTXTIN: Fixed a bug due to an IDL change where an index cannot be
    a string unless it is converted to numeric.  RES
31 Jul 1998
  WORDARRAY: Added new keyword NUMBER=nwds to return number of words.  RES
  COMMALIST: Added DELIMITER=del keyword to allow delimiters besides
    commas to be used.  Also fixed to work for alphabetic arrays.  RES
27 Jul 1998
  XHELP: Added optional SAVE button.  Just give save=file_name to give
    a default file name for the save.  RES
21 Jul 1998
  BOX2B: Added new exit option: List box position.  Lists in several
    formats, one is position in device (or normal) coord.  Can use
    to set a plot window.  RES
15 Jul 1998
  DT_TM_MAK: A bug was fixed by Tami Kovalick, Raytheon STX, 2 digit years
    failed beyond 1999.  RES
30 Jun 1998
  TAG_TEST: New function to test if a given tag occurs in a given
    structure.  Returns 1 if true, else 0.  RES
19 Jun 1998
  XTXTIN: Added new keywords XOFFSET=xoff, YOFFSET=yoff, see below.  RES
  XOPTION: Added new keywords XOFFSET=xoff, YOFFSET=yoff, see below.  RES
  XMESS: Added new keywords XOFFSET=xoff, YOFFSET=yoff to allow
    positioning this widget.  RES
  XHELP: Just added /no_block to the xmanager call so the program flow
    does not stop here.  This allows xhelp to simply display a useful
    block of text which stays on the screen.  The text in this display
    may be swept up with the mouse and used elsewhere.  RES
  PSTERM: Used the char size passed in by psinit.  RES
  PSINIT: New keyword CHARSIZE=csz, see below.  RES
  PRWINDOW: Added new keyword CHARSIZE=csz to be able to set the size
    of the comment along the side of the printed image.  This allows
    an easy way to list useful info on the image printout.  RES
  NUMPERSEC: New routine to estimate a rate.  Given some value which
    increases with time (such as MB read from a tape) this routine
    returns the number per second increase of that value.  RES
  FSLIDER_SETRANGE: New routine to set the floating point slider min
    and max values.  The floating point slider widget, cw_fslider, does
    not take the widget_control keywords set_slider_min and set_slider_max.
    This routine allows easy changing of those values.  RES
22 May 1998
  SECHMS: Yesterday's fix caused worse problems.  Now a small epsilon
    is added to the incoming value to allow for roundoff error.  The 
    default epsilon is 1E-12, that is the value used by the time
    software.  RES
22 May 1998
  NUMFRAC: New routine to convert a value or values to text strings with
    specified number of decimal places.  RES
21 May 1998
  SECHMS: This is where the DT_TM_MAK bug really got fixed.  RES
  PLTCRV: Added new keyword /XFIX to drop the option to edit x.
    Also fixed a bug that crashed the routine when the last point
    and the same x as the one before.
    Added /LOG to do log Y axis.
    Added /NORMALIZE to normalize curve max to 1.  RES
  DT_TM_MAK: Fixed a bug reported by Dr Dave Watts, Applications Programmer,
    Computing Services, Antarctic Division, Kingston, Tasmania 7050, Australia.
    Was not getting the correct second in some cases where the time was just
    a bit off from an integer value (-2E-14 off in one case).  Now rounds
    to nearest second if no fraction requested, or corrects the seconds
    if off when a fraction is used.  Should now operated as intended. RES
20 May 1998
  PLTCRV: Added XRANGE=xran and YRANGE=yran keywords to keep points
    within specified limits.  RES
18 May 1998
  GETENV2: Had to modify so it will compile when !base_dir does not
    exist.  Used the execute function to do this.  RES
  SPL_ANGINT: Attempt to fix requested angles to be within same range
    as anchor point angles.  Still needs work.  RES
14 May 1998
  SPL_ANGINT: Do a spline interpolation on a periodic angular function.
    Assumes function repeats after 2*PI or 360 deg.  RES
  EQV2: Added lock and unlock keywords to lock parameter values.  RES
13 May 1998
  EQV2: Added an optional OK button that sends an event to the specified
    widget.  Also now returns widget ID for the OK button.  This allows
    input_focus to be set to the OK button to switch context to EQV2
    from the calling routine.  RES
12 May 1998
  EQV2: Fixed to use its own plot window and not just the latest.  RES
  COLORS8BIT: New routine useful when you need to pick colors that will
    be visible when the mouse cursor is outside the IDL graphics window.
    This is useful when using 256 colors on a workstation, sometimes a
    widget becomes useless because the window contents becomes invisible
    when the mouse is moved to the widget (and not in the window).  RES
  RADII: Added new keyword /CLIP to clip to plot window.  Unfortunately
    the sister routine, ARCS, uses /NOCLIP to prevent clipping to the
    plot window (should be changed to use /CLIP).  RES
8 May 1998
  FIXANG: Upgraded to allow angles in radians also.  RES
7 May 1998
  EQV2: Allowed init lines in eqv file.  Useful to set up plot windows.  RES
  EQV2_LOAD_HELP: Added eqv file init lines.  RES
6 May 1998
  PLTCRV: Fixed a few minor problems, also updated some obsolete
    spline routines.  RES
4 May 1998
  XAUTOHELP_EXAMPLE: Example widget routine that uses xautohelp.  RES
  XAUTOHELP: New routine to display specified text whenever the cursor is
    moved over selected widgets in a widget application.  Typically such text
    would appear along the bottom of the widget application and could give
    some info on what the item does or how to use it.  RES
30 Apr 1998
  CREATED: Modified to use getenv2 instead of getenv.  This should allow
    porting to non-unix systems.  RES
29 Apr 1998
  EQV2: Fixed printout to give more room for the equation.  Also
    upgraded to ask if brightness should be reversed for a printout
    if that would reduce the amount of black or dark areas.  RES
24 Apr 1998
  EQV2: Upgraded by adding a number of new options and help text.  RES
  EQV2_LOAD_HELP: Uses text_block to load help text into variables.  RES
17 Apr 1998
  TVBOX: Fixed to be backward compatible with IDL 4.  RES
16 Apr 1998
  PLOTP: Added /CLIP keyword to clip to plot window for /DATA.  RES
  SUNALTAZI: Modified to handle arrays of times.  RES
15 Apr 1998
  SUNJS: Converted several if statements to calls to where so arrays
    of times can be used.  RES
  DT_TM_FROMJS: Just returned NUMBERS structure.  RES
  DT_TM_MAK: Added a returned structure with numeric values, NUMBERS.  RES
14 Apr 1998
  DT_TM_MAK: Added new format item, sam$ = seconds after midnight.  RES
10 Apr 1998
  MAGCRS: Added WINDOW keyword to allow use in a draw widget.
    Also added /NOCURSOR keyword to indicate that incoming coordinates
    are to be used as device coordinates instead of calling the CURSOR
    routine.  Use both WINDOW=win and /NOCURSOR for draw widgets.  RES
9 Apr 1998
  WHOCALLEDME: Generalized to look back farther then parent.  Added
    new keyword BACK=b.  Default is parent as before.  BACK=0 gives
    self, BACK=2 gives grandparent, BACK=3 gives great grandparent,
    and so on.  Going back too far gives null string results.  RES
8 Apr 1998
  MAGCRS: Fixed to show first mag window on /INIT.  Also cleaned up
    the help text some.  RES
7 Apr 1998
  IMGPOLREC: Upgraded to allow non-centered pixels.  The specified ranges
    in angle and radius used to apply to the centers of the first and last
    pixels in angle and radius.  Added new keywords, /A_EDGE and /R_EDGE, so
    the given ranges can apply to the pixel edges to get the full pixels
    instead of cutting the first and last in half as before.  If new
    keywords not used should give same results as before.  RES
1 Apr 1998
  WORDARRAY: Now allows the ignore characters to be given as a simple
    string of characters to drop before processing.  Also allows
    a string of delimiter characters to be given in the same way.  RES
  EQV2: Added /NO_BLOCK to xmanager call to free up command line.  RES
31 Mar 1998
  EQV2: Added SNAP button to make a snapshot of the current equation
    and settings.  RES
30 Mar 1998
  EQV2: Fixed an undefined variable problem.  RES
27 Mar 1998
  EQV2: Fixed a minor glitch that occured when entering a new equation
    file.  Also generalized to allow parametric equations.  This is
    done by specifying a trange instead of xrange, and giving
    x=fx(t) & y=fy(t) instead of just y=f(x).  Can now do circles
    very easily.  RES
20 Mar 1998
  DT_TM_FULL: Upgraded a bit to deal with dashes, slashes, and commas
    in date.  RES
18 Mar 1998
  TVBOX: Made 24 bit color compatible.  RES
  GETENV2: New more portable version of getenv.  You may set up files
    with values instead of using unix environmental variables.  Should
    work on any operating system.  On unix may use either files or
    environmental variables.  RES
10 Mar 1998
  RADON: Cleaned up a bit (fixed so fractional angle steps work) and
    removed the byte only restriction.  RES
9 Mar 1998
  EQV2: Added an optional int as 5th item for a parameter line in the eqv
    file.  This forces that value to be an integer, the slider value is
    truncated to an integer using the IDL fix function.  This is useful for
    setting flags if the equation is a user defined function, or for easily
    dealing with harmonics and so on.  A possible use is where the function
    has multiple variations based on an integer flag.  An example could be a 
    circle function that returns either the top or bottom half og the circle
    depending on whether a flag value is even or odd.  RES
6 Mar 1998
  EQV2: Added x scaling which gets applied after the equation gets
    executed but before plotting.  If the same integer scale factor
    is applied to the equation to scale y then harmonics may be
    easily plotted.  RES
3 Mar 1998
  TEXT_BLOCK: New routine to make it easy to print blocks of text.
    It will print all commented lines following its call in a routine,
    until the next uncommented line is found.  Also returns the text.  RES
2 Mar 1998
  EQV2: New routine to allow interactive function plotting on current window.
    Function parameters may be varied using widget sliders.  RES
24 Feb 1998
  EXDIFF: New routine to return difference between array extremes.
    Makes range array differences much more convenient.  RES
12 Feb 1998
  IMGUNDER: Made a conversion factor double.  RES
6 Feb 1998
  JSPLOT: Set defaults for the new keywords added yesterday.  RES
5 Feb 1998
  XVIEW: Fixed the save image problem in IDL 5.  RES
  BOX2B: Attempt to fix problem with last box erase on entry.  Better
    but still has some problems.  Also sometimes get a box of size 0.  RES
  JSPLOT: Fixed XTHICK, YTHICK, CHARTHICK to work correctly.  RES
  POINTS: Added new keyword /NORMALIZED to convert size in points
    to a size in normalized coordinates.  Returns a 2 element array
    since for non-square windows the size will be different in x and y.
    Intended to allow positioning using points.  RES
4 Feb 1998
  LINT: New routine to find the intersection of two lines in the XY plane.
    The two lines are each defined by giving two points on the line.  RES
3 Feb 1998
  DMS2D: New function to convert a string with degrees, minutes, and
    seconds to degrees as a double.  Inverse of d2dms.  Only works
    for scalar values.  May leave out sec or min and sec.  RES
23 Jan 1998
  CHECK5: New routine to check if running IDL version 5 or later.  RES
  CBAR: Added CHARTHICK keyword so that now works right.  RES
  SETCOLOR: Added new keyword BRIGHTNESS=fact to allow easy change in
    brightness of color.  Works with decimal or hex colors.  RES
19 Jan 1998
  SUNALTAZI: Renamed from sunpos to avoid a conflict with a routine of
    the same name in the IDLASTRO IDL library from GSFC.  The name is
    now better than it was but may be slightly confusing since the results
    are returned in the order azi, alt but the name has altazi.  Just
    be careful.  The conflict was pointed out by James Theiler of LANL.  RES
  SUN_ZD: Renamed a routine called internally from sunpos to sunaltazi.  RES
16 Jan 1998
  FILENAME: Changed to use !version.os_family instead of
    !version.os.  Was not working for Windows because !version.os
    was win32.  RES
15 Jan 1998
  MORE: Modified to be more portable.  It was using filepath(/terminal)
    which worked ok on unix but is not portable.  It now works pretty
    well for unix and not so well for Windows.  Can't seem to print a
    backspace in Windows.  RES
  COLOR: Modified to return as text color the darkest or brightest
    value, depending on what gives best contrast.  RES
14 Jan 1998
  Following routines modified to drop the use of !d.n_colors:
    chinit, color, color_quanj, colorwarn, crossi, crossi2, ctool, eqv,
    fill_cont, hline, hori, imgline, imgscale, jsplot, ls, makevlt,
    paint, pickcolor, pltcrv, rotvlt, shade_surf2, slowplot, sprint,
    sun_colors, testcolor, topc, veri, vimgseq, ,vline webshadow,
    xced1, xmerge, xtextimg, xview.  RES
9 Jan 1998
  IMGSQZ: New routine to squeeze out colors not used greatly to make
    room for custom colors.  Moves image and color table values around
    to put the freed colors at the bottom of the color table.  RES
8 Jan 1998
  SET_SCALE: Fixed a bug where of one of the requested floating values
    (x1,x2,y1,y2) was an int it was returned as an int.  Now forces floats. RES
31 Dec 1997
  JS2WEEKDAY: New routine to return week day given Julian Second.
    May return number or name.  RES
  JD2JS: Emphasized the fact that JD starts at noon.  RES
  JS2JD: Emphasized the fact that JD starts at noon.  RES
  DATE2JD: Minor help text fix.  RES
30 Dec 1997
  SUN_COLORS: Converted color table file to a text file to be more
    portable.  RES
  COLOR: Dropped the use of getenv to find the colors file.  Now uses
    whoami to look in the source directory for colors.txt.  Also converted
    colors file to a simple text file for easier use.  Should rewrite
    someday.  RES
18 Dec 1997
  DT_TM_FROMJS: Just passed new keyword DDECIMAL=ddec on to dt_tm_mak.  RES
18 Dec 1997
  DT_TM_MAK: Added new keyword DDECIMAL=ddec to set number of decimal
    places in day of year (if given in format).  Def=none.  RES
3 Dec 1997

  TVBOX: Modified to keep box size GE 1.  RES
3 Nov 1997
  IMGNEG: Simple image processing routine that converts a color image
    to its negative.  Used as an example for the new custom PROCESS
    pull-down in XVIEW.  RES
  XHOTLIST: Added browse option to this routine.  Should now allow
    system independent directory browsing.  RES
  XVIEW: Three upgrades: (1) Added browse option to directory hotlist,
    (2) Added user defined PRINT and PROCESS pull-down menus,
    (3) Added help to the HELP button.  RES
13 Oct 1997
  WEB_BACK: A primitive but effective routine to generate a background
    image for tiling a web page.  RES
25 Sep 1997
  FILEBREAK: Fixed to work for Windows IDL.  Still no support for the Mac
    since I don't have access to one.  RES
24 Sep 1997
  SWINDOW: Handled Win95 IDL bug for draw widget Y scroll bars.  RES
22 Sep 1997
  JD2YMD: Theo Brauers made loop index long to handle long arrays of JD.  RES
16 Jul 1997
  BEST_FFT: Added new keyword /DOWN to restrict search to sizes
    no greater than proposed size.  RES
11 Jul 1997
  VER: Added new keyword /OUT to plot pointers outside axes.  RES
  HOR: Added new keyword /OUT to plot pointers outside axes.  RES
10 Jul 1997
  DT_TM_FULL: New function to take a partial date/time string and
    expand it to a full date time string.  Useful to allow users to
    enter only times if they wish but still allow full date/times
    to be entered.  RES
8 Jul 1997
  BEST_FFT: Minor fix to avoid changing input value.  RES
1 Jul 1997
  CREATED: New routine to return a standard host, user, time stamp string.
    Ex: Created on tesla by Sterner on Tue Jul  1 14:22:15 1997
    Gives name of computer, the user name, and the time.  Intended to be
    added to file headers for reference.  RES
30 Jun 1997
  PRWINDOW: Added FACTOR=fct keyword.  RES
  PSIMG: Added new keyword, FACTOR=fct, to allow image size to be adjusted. RES
4 Jun 1997
  ROUND2: A version of round that works for big double precision numbers.
    For example, print,round2(9000000001.49999d0),form='(f20.5)' gives
    9000000001.00000, but round gives an error message and a wild value. RES
20 May 1997
  EVENT_LOG: Added new keyword ,/ADD, to add additional lines to last
    time tag in file.  This allows any number of lines under a given
    time tag.  Added /SCREEN to display text to screen too.
    Also slightly upgraded the help text.  This routine is
    really useful for logging events during processing.  For example
    errors and significant steps can be documented easily this way.  RES
15 May 1997
  PMATCH: Added new keyword, /ALL, to return indices of matches found.  RES
30 Apr 1997
  PMATCH: New routine to find a specified sequence of values in an array
    of numbers.  Does a pattern match using the where function.  RES
28 Apr 1997
  DT_TM_MAK: Very minor fix to help text.  RES
21 Apr 1997
  MAKEMS: New routine that makes an array from a starting point to
    an ending point using a maximum step size.  It steps by this size
    until within the step size and then steps the rest of the way to
    the end point.  This is useful for moving from one point to another
    but without going over a certain step size.  RES
14 Apr 1997
  POLY_FIT2: Added new keyword XFIT=xfit to allow fitted Y to be
    returned for all Xs even though only some are used to compute
    the fit.  RES
3 Apr 1997
  SELECT_INTERVALS: New routine.  From a list of short time intervals
    can select the ones that fall within a given lower and upper cutoff
    value.  Keywords to control if any or some of interval may extend
    outside range.  RES
18 Mar 1997
  RADII: Added new keyword THICKNESS=thk.  RES
17 Mar 1997
  PSTERM: Just capitalized user name.  RES
14 Mar 1997
  XVIEW: Changed 24-bit TIFF display to use color_quanj instead of
    color_quan.  color_quanj uses the JPEG image coloring algorithm
    and gives a greatly improved result over the previous method for
    some cases.  This is most noticeable where small areas are important
    but do not have enough pixels to make themselves known to the previous
    algorithm.  RES
  STATE_NAME: New function to return list of 2 letter abbreviations
    for U.S. states, or full state name given abbreviation.  Has several
    variants of the returned name.  RES
7 Mar 1997
  DIST_SCALE2: New routine, 2nd version of a distance scale.  RES
5 Mar 1997
  IMGUNDER: For PS was using pixels of size 1 point (1/72 inch).
    These looked too blocky so they were reduced to 1/2 point.  RES
27 Feb 1997
  XVIEW: Added vivid color print option.  RES
  XOPTION: Added a second submenu to allow unrelated options.  RES
24 Feb 1997
  ARCS: Added new keyword THICKNESS.  RES
21 Feb 1997
  SET_ISOXY:  Added new keyword charsize=csz.  RES
  PLOTWIN: Added new keyword charsize=csz.  RES
18 Feb 1997
  NAXES: Added new keyword /NO25 to disallow steps that are multiples
    of 2.5.  IDL does not appear to use such steps so this option
    better matches the selected IDL tick mark spacing.  RES
17 Feb 1997
  XVIEW: Added sharpening to Tools menu.  BW only.  RES
  TVSHARP: New routine to do a simple sharpening on currently displayed
    image.  BW only for now.  RES
  CONCOORD: Generalized to more than 4 points.  RES
13 Feb 1997
  SETCOLOR: New routine to allow a single color table entry to be
    set.  Input color specification may be in decimal or hex
    (web format).  RES
12 Feb 1997

  IZOOM: Corrected to handle small arrays.  The problem was this:
    Let a 4x4 array have x coordinates [0,1,2,3].  Izoom used to
    label the x axis 0 to 3 while displaying 4 pixels across.  This
    is not correct, it should label it 0 to 4.  This should now
    be fixed.  RES
